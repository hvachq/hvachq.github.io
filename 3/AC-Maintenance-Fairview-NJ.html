<p>While radon in water is not an issue in homes served by the majority of public water materials, it has been discovered in well water. If you have actually tested the air in your home and discovered a radon problem, and you have a well, get in touch with a lab certified to determine radiation in water to have your water tested. Radon issues in water can be easily fixed. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Volatile natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals discharged as gases from products or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, check out Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
