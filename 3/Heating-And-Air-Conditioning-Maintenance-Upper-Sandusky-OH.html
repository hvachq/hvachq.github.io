<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ may see undesirable or moldy odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are becoming worse, talk with your medical professional about them. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to provide enough changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
