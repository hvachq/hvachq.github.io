<p>Open windows or use exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common technique of reducing exposure to indoor air toxins, also will decrease but not eliminate exposure to ecological tobacco smoke. Due to the fact that smoking cigarettes produces such big quantities of toxins, natural or mechanical ventilation methods do not eliminate them from the air in your home as quickly as they build up. In addition, the large increases in ventilation it requires to significantly reduce direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can likewise increase energy costs significantly. Subsequently, the most efficient method to minimize exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the house is to remove cigarette smoking there.<p>
