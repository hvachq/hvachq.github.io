<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as crucial when it comes to central air expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to correctly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
