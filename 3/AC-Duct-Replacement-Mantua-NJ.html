<p>Specific kinds of HVAC systems are a little more expensive than wall units, ceiling or cassette systems are nicely concealed inside the ceiling in the classroom and are for that reason more discreet and aesthetically pleasing to look at. They offer effective air flow and are significantly more powerful than basic wall systems and can, therefore, reduce the variety of units needed and this can reduce installation and or replacement costs where multiple HVAC systems are needed. Ducted commercial-grade cooling systems are BETTER for the educational environment. They are generally the most costly alternative; however, they are likewise the most aesthetically pleasing as the duct-work and internal systems concealed with very little visibility.<p>
