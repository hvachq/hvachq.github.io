Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil.
