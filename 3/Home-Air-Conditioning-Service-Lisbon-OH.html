<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in pricey compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the abilities or tools essential to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and proper air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still required to have an expert technician check the system occasionally.<p>
