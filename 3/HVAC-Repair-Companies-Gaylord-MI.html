<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur in time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to suffice till you purchase a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
