<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Macon MS</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

For a long time I dismissed him however then I understood that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past.

Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you find you need to do it often, it's most likely time for an expert viewpoint.<p>
