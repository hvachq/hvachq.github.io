<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that may impact the health of people who live in the home. Toxins might come from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon entering your house from the ground listed below. An air pollutant might also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unpredictable natural substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care products. Viruses and bacteria, animal dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ may discover unpleasant or musty smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are worsening, talk with your doctor about them. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless hazardous gas. Since it is impossible to see, smell or taste, CO can kill you before you are aware it is in your house. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO causes mild effects that are typically mistaken for the influenza. These symptoms consist of headaches, lightheadedness, disorientation, nausea and tiredness. The impacts of CO exposure can vary considerably from person to individual depending on age, total health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
