<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or so.

<p>Self-installation tends to produce more problems than it solves. In reality, it often triggers professional intervention anyhow to fix a few of the concerns that were created throughout the installation.

Consult your state health or real estate department for ideas on which private laboratories or public firms may have the ability to help test your home for lead in paint. House test sets can not spot percentages of lead under some conditions. Hire an individual with unique training for remedying lead paint problems to remove lead-based paint.

That said, homebuyers aiming to go green," who prioritize energy savings, or who absolutely desire an in-floor heating system will want to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>
