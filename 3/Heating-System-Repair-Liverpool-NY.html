<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
