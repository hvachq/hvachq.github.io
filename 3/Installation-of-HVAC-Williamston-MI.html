<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is generally higher than many heat pump options, they can still be highly efficient, depending on the model you buy.

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence occupants. Unlike other kinds of air conditioning system, evaporative coolers rely on the outdoors air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the within a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be allowed to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to understand and keep.<p>
