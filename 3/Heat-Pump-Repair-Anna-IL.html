<p>These people have been great. At a real estate agent, I in some cases need contractors to provide me a viewpoint for what work on a home may cost. Just recently I required to contact these guys twice. They came out quickly and gave me a no nonsense estimate for the work. Even when it was news my client probably would not want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Integrity isn't simply their name, it's a service model they take seriously. You guys are formally on speed dial. Talk to you quickly.<p>

<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system, think about potential impacts of indoor air contamination. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, especially instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater properly changed. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is typically an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heating unit remains in use, open a door from the space where the heating unit lies to the remainder of the house and open a window a little.<p>
