<p>Unstable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals given off as gases from procedures or items; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
<p>Often a short-lived indoor air quality problem is created just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more intricate concerns-- determined by consistently unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the concern you're experiencing, among the 3 tactics below might be appropriate.<p>
