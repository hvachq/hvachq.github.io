<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Contractor in New London</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Since it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home through ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably simple procedure. Installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are including on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
