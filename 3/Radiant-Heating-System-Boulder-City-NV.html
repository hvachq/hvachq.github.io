<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for property owners to think about.
