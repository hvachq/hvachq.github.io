<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a business was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to develop business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners should strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the exact same in all other areas.<p>
