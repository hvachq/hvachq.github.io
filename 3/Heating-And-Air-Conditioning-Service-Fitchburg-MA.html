<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
