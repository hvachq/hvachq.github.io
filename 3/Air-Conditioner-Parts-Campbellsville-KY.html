<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
