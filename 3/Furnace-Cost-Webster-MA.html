<p>I have been using them for years for my companies, my own homes and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is honest, dependable, and sensible on rate. It's difficult to find a truthful AC man and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
