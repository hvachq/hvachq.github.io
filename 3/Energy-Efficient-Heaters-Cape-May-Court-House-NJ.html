<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
