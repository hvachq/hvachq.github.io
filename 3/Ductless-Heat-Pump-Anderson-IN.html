<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment).

In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
