<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from processes or products; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a brand-new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
