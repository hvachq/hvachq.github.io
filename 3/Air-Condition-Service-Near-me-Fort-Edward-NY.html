<p>IAQ can be impacted by gases (consisting of carbon monoxide gas, radon, volatile natural compounds ), particulates, microbial impurities (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stress factor that can cause negative health conditions.

<p>Excellent Product! Delivery was kind of weird being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was exceptionally lite weight and requires time to use. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we solved problems. I would suggest this item to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<p>Unstable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from items or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a brand-new carpet is likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might include unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>
