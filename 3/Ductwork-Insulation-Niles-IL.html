<p>Great service within 24 hours and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was very comprehensive and on-time in discussing what services would be carried out. Likewise Camryn offered terrific customer support at the end of the visit by explaining precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have actually done in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale strategies utilized by some in the industry.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but numerous use the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is probably a much better solution. If the existing system has actually not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and problems that caused the breakdown can be recognized and fixed, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense as well.<p>
