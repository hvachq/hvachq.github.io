They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they needed to purchase it. My spouse stated that she had seen a terrific evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He provided to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good individuals I have met in a very long time.
