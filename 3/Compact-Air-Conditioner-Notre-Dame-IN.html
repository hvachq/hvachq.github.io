<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location.

He included these substantial but small modifications in his bid. Because of recent warmer summertimes and for environmental factors, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
