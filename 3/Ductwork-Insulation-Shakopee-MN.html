An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run due to the fact that it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a possibility to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
