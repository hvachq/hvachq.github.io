<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>
