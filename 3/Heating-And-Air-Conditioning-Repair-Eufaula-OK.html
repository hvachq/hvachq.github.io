<h3>Central Heating Installation Service in Eufaula OK</h3>
<p>A hydronic glowing floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipes installed under the floor or right within the floor surface itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the flooring mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other short articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and individuals. It does not depend on heating or moving air to move heat.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
