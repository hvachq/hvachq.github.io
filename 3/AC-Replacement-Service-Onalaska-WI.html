<p>The residential or commercial properties and composition of the soil in an area can impact the rate at which heat is carried out through the ground.

Soil with positive heat transfer properties requires fewer pipes to accomplish the desired underground heating & cooling impact, while those with lowered thermal conductivity will require more pipes.<p>
<p>It may feel relaxing being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, however for people who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have breathing problems, winter can intensify issues. Stagnant indoor air and heating unit can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, pet dander, and mold spores flowing through your home. In late winter season and early spring, it may still be too cold to toss open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather condition it's important to be familiar with a few of the allergic reaction and breathing triggers that might be prowling in your environments.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ may notice undesirable or moldy smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
