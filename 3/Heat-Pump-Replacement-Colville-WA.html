Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that comfort.<p>

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
