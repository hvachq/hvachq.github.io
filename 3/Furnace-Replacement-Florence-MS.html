<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating units are still commonly utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>Central air systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
