The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.<p>
