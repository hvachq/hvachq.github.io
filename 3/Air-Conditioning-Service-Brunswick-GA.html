<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Services in Brunswick</h2>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace specialists often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
