<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost terrific however Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. Due to the fact that it just takes more electrical power to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize system does not lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the needed moisture. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
