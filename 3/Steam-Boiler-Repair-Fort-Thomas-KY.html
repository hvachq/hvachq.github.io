<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, a lot of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window.
