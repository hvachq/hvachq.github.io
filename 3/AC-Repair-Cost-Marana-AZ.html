<p>I usually don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
