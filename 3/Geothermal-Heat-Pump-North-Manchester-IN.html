Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in most buildings.

If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, considering that it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical guidelines remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
