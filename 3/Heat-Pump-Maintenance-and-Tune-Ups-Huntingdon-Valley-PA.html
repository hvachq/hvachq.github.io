In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.<p>
