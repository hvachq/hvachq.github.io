<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to work up until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for house owners to think about. Often times, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, given that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are typically just offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best choice for property owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
