The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
<p>Many modern air-conditioning systems feature a dehumidification cycle during which the compressor runs while the fan is slowed as much as possible citation required to minimize the evaporator temperature level and therefore condense more water. When the temperature falls listed below a threshold, both the fan and compressor are shut down to mitigate more temperature drops; clarification needed this avoids moisture on the evaporator from being blown back into the space. citation required When the temperature rises again, information needed the compressor restarts and the fan go back to low speed.<p>
