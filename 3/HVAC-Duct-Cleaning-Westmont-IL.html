<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they detected the issue and fixed very quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly simply as crucial when it pertains to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not be able to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
