<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can manage, so many Seattleites should find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring display screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to face the reality of a terrible, vicious summer season.<p>
