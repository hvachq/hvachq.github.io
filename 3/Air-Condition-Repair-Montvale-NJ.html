<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, instead of outside or industrial settings. In tasks where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It may also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to private areas.<p>
