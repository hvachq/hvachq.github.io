Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage.

The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
