<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
