<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, check out Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
