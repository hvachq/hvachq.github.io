The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power needs to not surpass the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units greater than the outside capacity by at least 20%.

Simply put, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that some of the rooms may not have an extremely comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the overall power is not simple, because it considers not only the nominal power of the systems, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. Due to the fact that it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off prior to it has an opportunity to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
