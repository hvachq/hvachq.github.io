<p>The most underrated HVAC component in your cooling system is the evaporator & condenser coil. The majority of people think the compressor is the only component that matters when making a big HVAC decision on changing your equipment.

<p>Central air conditioners, frequently referred to as central air" or split-system air conditioning", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floors covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioning system to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
