<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for years. However if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel costs all of a sudden appear greater than regular, it is probably time to think about a new system. New heating equipment is even more effective-- you'll see lower fuel bills right away, not to discuss the cash you'll save on repair expenses. If your heating system is 25 years old or more, you can most likely anticipate to cut your fuel bills in half.<p>

<h3>Floor Heating System in Potsdam New York</h3>
<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>In 2011, NASA watched for a cooling system to set up in their lunar electric rover. They chose they needed professional aid and consulted various suppliers.
