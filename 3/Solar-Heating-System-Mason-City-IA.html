<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
