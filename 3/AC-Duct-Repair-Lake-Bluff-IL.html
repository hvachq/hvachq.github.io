<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level.

<h3>Maximizing the Efficiency of Your HVAC System at Lake Bluff IL</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We chose getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our biggest utility costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
