<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you ought to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
