Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
