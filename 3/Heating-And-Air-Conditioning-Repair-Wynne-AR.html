<p>Efficient heating and air conditioning services are important for every single Florida property owner. In the hot, damp climate of the higher Tampa Bay area, you need an a/c that will keep both the heat and humidity at bay. Winters included periodic bursts of cold weather condition that make a touch of heat incredibly welcome. From heating and cooling to indoor air quality, Scott's One Hour Cooling & Heating has you covered.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioner works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
