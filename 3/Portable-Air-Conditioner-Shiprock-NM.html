<p>Poor indoor air quality is generally caused by the lack of appropriate ventilation, which leads to a buildup of pollutants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined insufficient ventilation as the main problem in over half the workplace indoor air investigations it has actually performed. Examinations carried out in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have discovered the exact same to be real. These examinations revealed that appropriate ventilation is important in keeping great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are prone to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot next to the radiators. This generally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides heat from the floor up throughout the room without any cold spots or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>
