<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the standard water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>

When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
