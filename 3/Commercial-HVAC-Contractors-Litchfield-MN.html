<p>Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is upgraded every four years. The Basics Handbook includes heating and cooling computations. The design professional should seek advice from ASHRAE data for the standards of design and care as the typical building codes offer little to no details on HVAC style practices; codes such as the UMC and IMC do consist of much information on installation requirements, however. Other helpful referral products consist of products from SMACNA, ACGIH, and technical trade journals.<p>

<p>Central air conditioners, typically referred to as central air" or split-system a/c", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floors, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers.
