<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not use car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..
