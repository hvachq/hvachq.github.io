<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
