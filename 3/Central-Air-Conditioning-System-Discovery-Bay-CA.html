<p>A/c unit makers typically make rugged, high quality products. If your air conditioning unit fails, begin by examining any merges or circuit breakers. Let the unit cool off for about 5 minutes prior to resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch might have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, located in the compressor's gain access to panel.<p>
