<p>Radiant heating systems do not make use of ducts, which makes them a fair bit more energy effective than other systems. They also do not create cold and hot spots. All of the heat that radiant heat systems disperse moves through strong items, keeping the heat near the floor of the room where it is the most use. Radiant heat systems can likewise heat rooms with less energy invested, and keep them warmed for longer, since a lot of floors tend to maintain heat better than air does.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it really quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
