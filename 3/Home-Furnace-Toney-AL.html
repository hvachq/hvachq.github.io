<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We decided on getting something more pricey than a traditional water heater as gas is among our greatest utility costs. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>

No additional charge.<p>
