Because the energy used to heat your house is extracted straight from the ground, it secures the environment from damaging digging, fracking, or toxins.

<p>A/c can also be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.
