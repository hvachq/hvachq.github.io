Temperature levels need to vary from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by too much air circulation should be avoided. Maintenance of appropriate temperatures and humidity levels and appropriate air flow will help to decrease the occurrence of upper respiratory signs, and, perhaps, skin rashes.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol result, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which might enter close-by ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outside water fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
