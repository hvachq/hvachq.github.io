<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Gwynn Oak MD Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been running issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
