<p>Sean was really valuable. He is an extremely enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Check these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
