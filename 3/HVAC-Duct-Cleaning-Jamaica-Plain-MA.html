In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite significant.<p>
