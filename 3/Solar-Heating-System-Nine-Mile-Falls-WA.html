<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.. Secondly like prolonged automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to correctly service and the system has been operating problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
