<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
