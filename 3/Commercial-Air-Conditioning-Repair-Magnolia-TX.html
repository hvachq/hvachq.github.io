<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. An excellent place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there haven't troubled with it!

Supervisors with BPI accreditation know that the home is a system and see HVAC equipment as just one aspect (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>
