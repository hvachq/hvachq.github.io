<h3>Furnace Cost in Carnegie PA 15106</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
