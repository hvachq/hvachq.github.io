<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things initially. Ensure all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
