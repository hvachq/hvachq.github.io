<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).

<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't offer off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice till you buy a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around repairing the issue, all the while explaining everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
