<h3>Common Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Southgate MI</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas.
