A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear.

During high usage months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine elements. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
