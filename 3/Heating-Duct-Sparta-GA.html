<h3>Things to Look for When Selecting an Sparta GA HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning feelings in the eyes and throat, nausea, and trouble in breathing in some humans exposed at raised levels (above 0.1 parts per million).

It has likewise been shown to cause cancer in animals and may trigger cancer in human beings.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to effectively service and the unit has been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
