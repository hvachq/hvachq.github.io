<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by people and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>
