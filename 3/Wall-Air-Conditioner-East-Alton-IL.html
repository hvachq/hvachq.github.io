<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
