<p>Airborne irritants are simply a truth of life. Molds can trigger flare-ups of allergic reaction symptoms, and in many cases, trigger asthma attacks. Viruses, germs, and bacteria also can reside in the air you breathe every day. These airborne contaminants can affect your house comfort devices, too. Permitted to flow through your home and your system, these and other particles can build up on the indoor coil, hindering air flow and decreasing heating and cooling performance. By using the services and products we offer, you can reduce and frequently get rid of these unwanted airborne contaminants from your house, leaving clean air and safe surface areas throughout your family.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
