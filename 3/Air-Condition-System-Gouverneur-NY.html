<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is typically higher than many heat pump choices, they can still be extremely efficient, depending on the design you purchase. One of the main advantages of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperature levels than other heating alternatives. This means it can warm up your house to the desired temperature level quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
