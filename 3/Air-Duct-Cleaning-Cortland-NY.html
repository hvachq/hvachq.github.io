<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. Gradually, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Prior to that takes place, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
