<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
