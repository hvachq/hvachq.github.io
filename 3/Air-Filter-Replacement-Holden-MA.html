Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again. He is truthful, dependable, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 must be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be necessary.<p>
