<h3>What to Search for When Selecting an Matthews NC HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions require. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. In addition, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
