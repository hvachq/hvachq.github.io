HVAC experts advise following this basic guideline when choosing whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
<p>The very first ac system and fridges utilized harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could lead to fatal accidents when they leaked.

The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough task that the employees sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.
