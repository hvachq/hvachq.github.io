<p>Another contaminant of indoor air is outside air. At the height of the pollen season or when the air quality index is unhealthy, individuals with asthma might find being inside provides the best relief, if the indoor air environment is excellent. Although a/c does not filter the air, it helps people with asthma because windows and doors are kept shut, which assists keep pollens and other outdoor irritants and allergens out of the home.

<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ problem. Your employer needs to check measurements of temperature, air and humidity flow. In addition, examination and screening of the ventilation, heating and cooling systems (to make certain it is working according to requirements for building use and tenancy) ought to be performed.

For instance, in schools asbestos requires to be examined every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Reaction Act-AHERA).<p>
