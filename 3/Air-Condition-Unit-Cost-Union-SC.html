<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 need to be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements used for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
