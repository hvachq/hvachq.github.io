<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have been shown to trigger the health effects mentioned. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily real that the impacts kept in mind occur at the pollutant concentration levels generally found in the house. In many cases, our understanding of the toxins and their health results is too limited to identify the levels at which the listed effects could occur.<p>
<p>Usually the most reliable method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the amount of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more affordable technique to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later on in this section.<p>
<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is frequently important to determining the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such details can often be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If keeping track of data is not available, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent need to ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out. Review of this information might identify potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when impurity concentrations are very low, monitoring information may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
