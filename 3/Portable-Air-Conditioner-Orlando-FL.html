<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ might notice unpleasant or moldy smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, speak to your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
