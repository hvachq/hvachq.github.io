<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
