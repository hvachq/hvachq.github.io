<p>Air pollutants can range from impurities generated from the outdoors by your family pets to hazardous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a typical air pollutant arising from gas that escapes into your home without being burnt. Older homes may include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In bathrooms and cooking areas, mold and mildew can end up being a nuisance where wetness levels are usually greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, but it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more residents there are in a space or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable impact on occupants-- outside air needs to be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
