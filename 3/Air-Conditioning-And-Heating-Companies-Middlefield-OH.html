<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
