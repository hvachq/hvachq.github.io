<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, most Midtown Houston Tx customers do not know why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's more than likely your problem. If you found that your conditioning filter needs replacing, then the next action is to thaw your a/c devices. The easiest method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
