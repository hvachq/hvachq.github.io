<p>Before you head out and purchase an air conditioner, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be installing the ac system? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How big should the a/c be? Too big and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c unit and shorten its life. Too small and your a/c will not be able to cool your house appropriately. These are just a few of the elements that you require to consider when buying a brand-new AC system. Each option can and will significantly impact your system's performance, which is why you can't pay for to ignore any of them.<p>
<p>Mobile homes are usually smaller than stick-built homes and use significantly less oil and a much smaller furnace to heat. Expect the average mobile house oil furnace to have starting expenses of around $1,500. Remember that not as many brand names produce oil heating systems for this use, and you might discover more choices with gas, lp, or electric furnaces.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, often described as central air conditioning" or split-system cooling", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floors covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
