<p>A packaged unit, typically set up on the roofing, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, but it is likewise an alternative for property owners to consider. Many times, these systems include not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those wanting to save money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system separately, given that the system is integrated.
