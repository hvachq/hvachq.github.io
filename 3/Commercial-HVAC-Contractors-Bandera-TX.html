Their techs are very well-informed and professional. Costs are sensible. Always on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff set up a brand-new air handler and condenser this week. Due to the fact that the cost was certainly sensible, I did not bother to get competitor's quotes because of my rely on Waychoff.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. Because it merely takes more electricity to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off prior to it has an opportunity to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
