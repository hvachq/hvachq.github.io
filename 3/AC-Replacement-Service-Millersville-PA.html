<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
