<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the see. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a fast web search validated WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the new part. I was really happy they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>
