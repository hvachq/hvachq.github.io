Put simply, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces might not have a really comfy temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, considering that it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
