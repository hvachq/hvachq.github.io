<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
