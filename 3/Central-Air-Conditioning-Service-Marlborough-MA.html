Radiant heat systems tend to be a lot more energy effective than other heating systems, for something. Forced air heating systems tend to experience things like duct leaks, which rob them of as much as 30% of their output.

Most home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors eliminate contaminants directly from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
