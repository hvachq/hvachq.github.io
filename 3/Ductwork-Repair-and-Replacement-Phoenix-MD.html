<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating aspects set up in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically connected to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>

<p>Old lead-based paint is the most substantial source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous direct exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is incorrectly eliminated from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in homes can also arise from lead dust from outdoor sources, including contaminated soil tracked inside, and use of lead in specific indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>Just like a lot of home enhancement tasks, the cost of a complete central heating system can differ extensively based on the size of the home. Most heaters will last between 15 and twenty years. In picking a furnace, homeowner should think about heat output and efficiency. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A little home, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too quickly and turn off for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
