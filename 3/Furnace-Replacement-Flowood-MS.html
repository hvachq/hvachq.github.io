<h3>Advantages of Professional AC Repair in Flowood MS</h3>
<p>There are lots of reasons why this can take place. The good news is that you can address much of these elements by yourself without the requirement to call for professional assistance. Start by opening the heat signs up and after that proceed to checking the thermostat settings. Next, inspect the furnace power, reset the furnace or inspect the service door cover. You can likewise inspect the filter to make sure it is clear of dirt and check the standing pilot burner to make certain it is lit.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the space temperature, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
