<p>If you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they had to purchase it. My better half said that she had seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most good individuals I have fulfilled in a very long time.
