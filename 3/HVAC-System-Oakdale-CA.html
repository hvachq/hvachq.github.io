<p>A customized a/c that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning unit in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, because all elements of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is in fact warmed, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
