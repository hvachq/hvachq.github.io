Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the objective of owning an organisation was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end goal.
