<p>A/c can also be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
