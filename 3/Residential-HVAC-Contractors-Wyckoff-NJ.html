Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
