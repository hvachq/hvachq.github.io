<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging product to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, location 2 2x4s below package to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>A Trane a/c can range in cost from $4,000 - $10,000. Our prices guide describes all the elements that affect your price. The cost of your air conditioning system will vary depending on the size of your house, design you choose, special installation requirements - even where you live and the climate in your area. You can reduce your expenses thanks to local rebates, special offers and tax credits To get the most precise cost for your home, schedule a home assessment with your local dealer.<p>
