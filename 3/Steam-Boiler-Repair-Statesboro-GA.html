<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were very popular in the very first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial structures, apartment and large homes. Lots of steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago stay operable, because the lack of moving parts makes them less susceptible to use and tear.
