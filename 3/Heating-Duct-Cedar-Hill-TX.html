<p>A/c can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage.

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
