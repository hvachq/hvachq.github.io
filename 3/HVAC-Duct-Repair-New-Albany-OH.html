<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently higher wages for air conditioning tradesmen. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable environment, or merely a high level of competition for competent trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's highest typical incomes for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year. Massachusetts and Connecticut rounded out the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 per year.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your house that perfect temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can result in costly repairs down the road. So, make sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service plan which typically includes a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
