<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists if no pollutant sources are found. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air.

<p>For toxins other than radon, measurements are most proper when there are either health symptoms or signs of bad ventilation and specific sources or contaminants have been recognized as possible reasons for indoor air quality problems.

<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service at Bala Cynwyd PA</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the math recently, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they offer me favoritism, and want to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>

He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour.
