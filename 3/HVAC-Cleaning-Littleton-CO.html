HVAC specialists suggest following this standard rule when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost majority the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
<p>The very first a/c and fridges used combustible or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could result in deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
