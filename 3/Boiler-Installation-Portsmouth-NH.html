<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads.

Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis.
