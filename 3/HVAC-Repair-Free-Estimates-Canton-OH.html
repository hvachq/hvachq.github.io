Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
