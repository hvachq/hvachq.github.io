While toxins commonly found in indoor air can cause many harmful effects, there is significant uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are required to produce specific illness.

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists if no impurity sources are found. Extreme re-circulation of air results in "stagnant air" conditions.
