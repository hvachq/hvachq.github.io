Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
