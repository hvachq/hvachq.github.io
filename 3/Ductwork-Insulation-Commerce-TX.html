<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit boost. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump can be quickly incorporated with existing systems such as traditional forced air or radiant floor heating or can be set up in a new building.
