<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Second of all, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, make sure that an efficient moisture barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. Do temporarily adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it becomes damp.<p>
