<p>Air pollutants can vary from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your animals to dangerous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air toxin arising from gas that leaves into your home without being burnt.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
