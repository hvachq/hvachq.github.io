Combustion products from automobile exhaust, heating systems, hot water heater, area heating units, aromatic candles, oil lamps, wood ranges, fireplaces, and gas ranges that are not appropriately vented can generate carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates.

However, for the majority of the United States and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to supply thermal comfort inside. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities give rise to mold development and moisture inside your home is associated with a higher frequency of resident breathing problems.<p>
