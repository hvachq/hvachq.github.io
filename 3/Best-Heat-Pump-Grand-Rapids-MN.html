<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible factor could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the appropriate temperature level. Heaters that kick on regularly may be because of a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem.
