<p>Many people are becoming more worried and aware about their health and the effect of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt consisting of allergens and pollutants can cover the a/c ductwork with time. Occasionally it needs to be eliminated to improve and refresh the quality of indoor air and improve the cooling. Beacon Pipes, Seattle, WA cleans the duct physically by removing the particles from the air filter.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
