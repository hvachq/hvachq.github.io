Because it simply takes more electrical energy to run a larger system, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to run. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
