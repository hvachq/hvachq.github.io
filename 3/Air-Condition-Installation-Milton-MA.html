<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around given that the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and tied them into a warm water supply. Romans utilized a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and a primary pumping machine to circulate warm water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the harmony of the floor heat transferred heat to other posts in the rooms, including the human residents.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by distributing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

Send for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to find out more about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water.
