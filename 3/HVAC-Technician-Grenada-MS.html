<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you need to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
