<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run because it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit. Because it merely takes more electricity to run a larger unit, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to run. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the needed moisture. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
