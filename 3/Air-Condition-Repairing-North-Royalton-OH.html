<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems in houses. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the house. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges prohibited. 30 DuPont and other companies obstructed the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the method as "that German technology". 29 31 However, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to produce a business coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take actions to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-404a, r-410a and r-134a are, as of 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and a/c, R-1234yf in cars and trucks, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is already widely used in residential refrigeration.<p>
