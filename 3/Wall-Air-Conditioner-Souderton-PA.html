However, if your system does not appear to be working properly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you must call in a specialist to repair the unit and inspect.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either since of visible growth or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run since it merely takes more electrical power to run a bigger system. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In truth, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>

<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>The likelihood of instant reactions to indoor air toxins depends upon several factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 important impacts.
