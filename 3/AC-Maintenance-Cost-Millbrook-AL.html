<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..
