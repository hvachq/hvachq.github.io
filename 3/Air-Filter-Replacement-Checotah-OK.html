<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
