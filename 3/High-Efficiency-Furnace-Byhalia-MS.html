Purchased a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
