<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in Waipahu HI</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in home building and construction is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofs, walls, and floors. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor impurities and assists exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven. Squealing sounds from a belt-drive air handler usually happen when the belt that links the motor to the blower slips. Most of the times, the belt is incorrectly aligned or used and needs replacement. Follow the directions above under Air conditioning system Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
