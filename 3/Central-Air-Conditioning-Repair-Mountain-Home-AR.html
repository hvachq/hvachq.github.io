<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, given that some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
