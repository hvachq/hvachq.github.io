<p>Central air units are determined in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes old and unclean.
