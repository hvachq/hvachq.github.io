<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Own Furnace in Stafford Springs CT</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes far more severe with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more traditional form of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump throughout harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is utilized efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding sounds. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven. When the belt that links the motor to the blower slips, squealing noises from a belt-drive air handler typically happen. For the most part, the belt is improperly lined up or worn and requires replacement. Follow the instructions above under Air conditioning unit Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's manual.<p>
