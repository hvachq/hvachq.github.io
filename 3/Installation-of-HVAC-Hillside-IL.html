Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this.
