<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
