<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building and construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices manufacturer's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in place. In addition, the concrete outcomes of a PM is often hard to measure, as one response mentioned the cost savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't simply break at the breeze of a finger, but rather is the outcome of recurring usage of an element that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering early deterioration, leading to holes and cracks. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.  an extremely beneficial result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
