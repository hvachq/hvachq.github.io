<p>Prior to you go out and buy an ac system, there are a few things to decide first. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioning system? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How large should the a/c unit be? Too big and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can harm the air conditioner and reduce its life. Too little and your a/c unit won't be able to cool your home appropriately. When going shopping for a new AC system, these are simply a few of the aspects that you need to take into account.

So, be sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service strategy which typically includes a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
