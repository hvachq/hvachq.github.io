<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a really enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues aside from the blower motor.

He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run because it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has an opportunity to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The result is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
