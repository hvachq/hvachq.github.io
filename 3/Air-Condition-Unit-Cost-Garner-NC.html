<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate fantastic however Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money coming in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
