<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have a problem as long as your home still heats up to the best temperature. The temperature of the air produced by the heatpump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel very hot. If your home is not heating up, just be concerned. Nevertheless, if your system does not seem working appropriately, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you must employ a professional to repair the unit and inspect.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
