<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
