<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.

As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair.
