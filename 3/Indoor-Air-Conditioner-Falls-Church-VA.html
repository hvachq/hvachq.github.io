<h3>Heating And Cooling Services in Falls Church VA 22042</h3>
<p>The federal government recommends that homes be weatherized in order to minimize the amount of energy required for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, actions should also be required to lessen contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, homeowners must look out to the introduction of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization steps should not be undertaken until these issues have actually been corrected.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that just a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, however a property owner doesn't have the tools or skills required to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are important to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the needed devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still essential to have an expert technician check the system occasionally.<p>
<p>Filters can get dirty easily, especially if you live in an area that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, particles, germs, and tidy the air. They are accountable for keeping the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and replaced frequently, your HVAC system will ultimately stop carrying out as you anticipate it to.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
