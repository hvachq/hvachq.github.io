<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it might suck up to two times the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to offer a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed just a few years earlier.<p>

Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. Attempt a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
