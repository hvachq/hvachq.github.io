<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside system as near to the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Ventilation removes undesirable smells and excessive moisture, introduces outside air, keeps interior building air distributing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>

<p>. Before choosing the installation location of a/c unit, a number of primary factors require to be thought about. First off, the instructions of air circulation from the indoor units need to not fall on the place of rest or work area.
