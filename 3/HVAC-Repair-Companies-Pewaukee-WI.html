Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase efficiency even further by running at lower or higher capability depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Because it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for performance. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated procedure. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
