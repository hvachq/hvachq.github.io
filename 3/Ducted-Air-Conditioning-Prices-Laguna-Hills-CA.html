<p>Professional heater setups. However, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually fail. HVAC professionals recommend following this standard rule when deciding whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>
