<h3>Air And Heat Repair in Kalamazoo Michigan</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>To be honest, few of the centers managers who utilize our indoor air quality monitoring service concerned us because of that.
