<p>There are some ranges of mold that contain harmful compounds (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible for the most part, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the released spores. The main danger of mold growth, as it associates with indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic residential or commercial properties of the spore cell wall. More major than many allergenic residential or commercial properties is the ability of mold to trigger episodes face to faces that already have asthma, a severe breathing disease.<p>

<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his examination, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>I highly advise using this service. Very reliable extremely great. Looked after a part that was not covered under service warranty quick and efficient and did not need to pay a leg and an arm to get it done. Terrific company begun by a man who is aiming to grow his company and secure his household. He set up a complete system inside and out. Terrific system and a very good cost. I am currently on the maintance plan. He takes care of it twice a year with out having to be advised to do it.<p>
