<h3>Ductless Heat Pump in Chattanooga TN 37421</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite HVACS on among the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out very same day to examine circumstance & chose to choose them for the work. I am happy to state that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but likewise changed the heating unit which was old. Everybody we spoke with from starting to end were really professional, considerate and the work was very effectively done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we suggest utilizing our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when utilized in combination with underfloor heating by functioning as an extremely efficient thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of permitting heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>I am very pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company many years earlier and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
