<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future.
