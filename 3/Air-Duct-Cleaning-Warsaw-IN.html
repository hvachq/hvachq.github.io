<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to use auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement..
