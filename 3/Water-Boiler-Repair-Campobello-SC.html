<p>I generally do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
