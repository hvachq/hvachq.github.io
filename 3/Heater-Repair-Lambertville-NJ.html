<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Since it simply takes more electricity to run a larger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
