<p>There are lots of actions a house owner can take to select products that will avoid indoor air issues from taking place - a number of them are discussed here.

Second of all, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, ensure that a reliable moisture barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet.
