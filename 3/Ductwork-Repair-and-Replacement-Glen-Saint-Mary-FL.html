<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor unit as near to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)
