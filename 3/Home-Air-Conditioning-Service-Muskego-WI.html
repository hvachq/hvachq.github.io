<p>Since an air conditioning system moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
