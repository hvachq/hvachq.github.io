<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a recommendation later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
