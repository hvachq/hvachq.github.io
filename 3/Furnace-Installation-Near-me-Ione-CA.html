<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
