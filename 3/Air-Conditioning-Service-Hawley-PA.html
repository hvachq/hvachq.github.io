<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>

(He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
