<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>

A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.
