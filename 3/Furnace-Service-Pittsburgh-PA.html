<p>Indoor air quality (also called "indoor ecological quality") describes how within air can affect a person's capability, comfort, and health to work. It can include temperature level, humidity, absence of outside air (bad ventilation), mold from water damage, or direct exposure to other chemicals. Presently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) requirements however it does provide standards about the most typical IAQ workplace problems.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute contaminated (indoor) air. Local building regulations most likely specify the quantity (and in some cases quality) of outside air that must be constantly supplied in your structures, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation combined with appropriate use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for instance, can be beneficial in watering down the concentration of toxic fumes in the air.<p>
