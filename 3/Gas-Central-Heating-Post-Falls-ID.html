<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same toxins. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside system as near to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne.
