<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
