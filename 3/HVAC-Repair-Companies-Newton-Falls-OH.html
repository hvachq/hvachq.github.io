<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material gradually. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
