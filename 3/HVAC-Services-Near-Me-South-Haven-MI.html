<h3>Appropriate Things To Consider In Your South Haven MI Commercial HVAC Service Provider</h3>

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix utilized in cars in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12.

For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by lots of individuals.<p>

Honestly, our home heater is made complex, Rob and his team repaired the old duct work, altered all the dampers, make the whole system work perfectly.<p>
