However if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel bills unexpectedly seem higher than normal, it is most likely time to consider a new system.

<p>Reality: Federal and local rewards generally amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial price of a system competitive with conventional equipment.

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. However, brand-new installation practices are reducing expenses, to the point where the cost is getting closer to conventional systems under the best conditions.<p>
