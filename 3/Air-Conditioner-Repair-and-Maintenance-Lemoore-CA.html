<h3>Central Heating Installation Service in Lemoore CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
