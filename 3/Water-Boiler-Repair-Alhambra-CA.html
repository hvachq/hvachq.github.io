<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Suitable Duct Sealing in Alhambra CA</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in house building and construction is to minimize air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, roofs, and floorings. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air assists and dilutes indoor impurities exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
