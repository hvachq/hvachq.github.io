<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by improving airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness.

In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>Inquire about training and certifications. A good location to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's type of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Structure Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification. Managers with BPI accreditation understand that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as simply one aspect (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity ought to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is often important to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such details can often be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the company. If keeping track of information is not offered, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent should ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Review of this data may identify possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are really low, keeping an eye on data might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
