<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary problem. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, given that some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>

<p>Self-installation tends to produce more problems than it fixes.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to use automobile debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
