Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut down totally.<p>
