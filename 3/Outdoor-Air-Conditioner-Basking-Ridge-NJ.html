<p>Let's start by detailing the planning that needs to happen prior to you in fact buy a furnace. Choosing a furnace for your home isn't as simple as choosing one off a showroom floor. Not all heating systems are good for all homes, and there are a couple of factors that definitely need to be considered prior to selecting one. First, you'll need one that is correctly sized for your home. A furnace that is too large will put out excessive heat for your system to manage, and will cause problems like short-cycling that can shorten its life. A furnace that is too little, on the other hand, will not be able to supply adequate heat to keep your home comfortable.<p>
