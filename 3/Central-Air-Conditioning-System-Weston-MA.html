<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heatpump While space cooling offers maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool numerous rooms at a time it is usually more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
