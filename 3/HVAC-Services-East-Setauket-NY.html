<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same pollutants. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heater, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

This was originally driven by rising energy costs, and has actually more just recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological concerns. Additionally, enhancements to the HVAC system efficiency can also help increase occupant health and performance. 21 In the US, the EPA has enforced tighter limitations throughout the years. There are several techniques for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>
<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are used to seeing this key in the backyards of houses. With split system units, the majority of the elements are housed in a metal box outside of the home. However, there are some internal parts as well. Split systems are perfect for cooling numerous rooms at once, but are not really energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud devices in the house.
