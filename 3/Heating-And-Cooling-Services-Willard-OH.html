Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning unit will need more energy to cool your home. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can likewise exacerbate indoor air quality issues.
