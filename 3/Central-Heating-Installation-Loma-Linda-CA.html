<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not release heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place in time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay.
