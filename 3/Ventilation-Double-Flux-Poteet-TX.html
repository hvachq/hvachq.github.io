<p>Air conditioner makers generally make rugged, high quality items. Begin by inspecting any merges or circuit breakers if your air conditioner fails. Let the system cool off for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
