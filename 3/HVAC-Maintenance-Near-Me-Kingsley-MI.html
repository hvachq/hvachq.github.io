<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to reduce the quantity of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, actions need to also be required to decrease contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.) In addition, citizens must look out to the introduction of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization procedures must not be carried out up until these issues have been remedied.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements.

<p>Its distinct feature is the presence of one main external unit that connected to a number of indoor units.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material gradually. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
