<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, check out Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
