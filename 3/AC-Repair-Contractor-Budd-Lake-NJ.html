The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air helps and waters down indoor contaminants tire them from the home.<p>
