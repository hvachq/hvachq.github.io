<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, as opposed to outdoor or industrial settings. In tasks where union subscription is not a problem, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It may also include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to private spaces.<p>
<p>The capability of organic chemicals to cause health effects varies greatly, from those that are highly poisonous, to those with no recognized health effect.

At present, not much is understood about what health impacts take place from the levels of organics normally discovered in houses. Numerous organic compounds are understood to trigger cancer in animals; some are suspected of triggering, or are known to cause, cancer in human beings.<p>

<p>We called Elite HVACS on one of the hottest days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out exact same day to examine situation & decided to opt for them for the work.

<p>Lots of individuals are becoming more concerned and conscious about their health and the effect of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt containing pollutants and allergens can cover the a/c ductwork with time. Sometimes it must be eliminated to boost and revitalize the quality of indoor air and improve the cooling.

<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless hazardous gas. Because it is difficult to see, smell or taste, CO can kill you before you know it remains in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO triggers moderate effects that are often incorrect for the influenza. These signs consist of headaches, lightheadedness, fatigue, disorientation and nausea. The effects of CO exposure can vary considerably from individual to person depending on age, total health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
