<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
