<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. When the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively harden and cure-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
