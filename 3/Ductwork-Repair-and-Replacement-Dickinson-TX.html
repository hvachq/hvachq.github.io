<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one constraint: their total power needs to not go beyond the capability of the outside system. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, given that the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outside unit. Basically, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that a few of the spaces may not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not easy, because it takes into account not only the small power of the units, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>My oldest child always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I understood that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The sound level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
