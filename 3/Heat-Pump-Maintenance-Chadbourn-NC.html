You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that might impact the health of individuals who reside in the home. Contaminants could come from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, yard trash burning, or radon going into the house from the ground listed below. An air pollutant might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or personal care items. Infections and germs, pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
