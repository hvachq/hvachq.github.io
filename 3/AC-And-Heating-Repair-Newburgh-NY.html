<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material in time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
