<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not use them.  Second of all like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my services, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again. He is sincere, trusted, and sensible on cost. It's hard to find a truthful AC person and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
