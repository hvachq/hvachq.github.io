<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that ideal temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those common air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their job.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
