<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated.
