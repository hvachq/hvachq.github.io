<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with routine preventive maintenance, however, there will constantly be the odd issue that occasionally shows up. When you do notice your furnace behaving oddly, it is very essential that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible. The faster you respond to issues with your furnace, the easier they are to fix. Waiting to require repairs will just make the problem worse, and typically more pricey.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your house will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

Packaged air conditioners typically include electric heating coils or a gas furnace. This combination of air conditioning unit and central heating unit removes the need for a different furnace inside.<p>
<p>HVAC coils generally provide you an excellent 15-20 years of life prior to they begin establishing refrigerant leakages. Refrigerant leaks aren't the only issue air conditioning coils have.
