<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not use them.. Secondly like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
