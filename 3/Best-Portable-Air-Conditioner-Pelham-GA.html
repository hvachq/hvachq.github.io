<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide automobile debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
