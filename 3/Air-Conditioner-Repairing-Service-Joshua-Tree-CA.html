<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it really quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips.
