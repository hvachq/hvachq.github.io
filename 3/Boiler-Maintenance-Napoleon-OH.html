<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main problem. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more difficulties, since some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
