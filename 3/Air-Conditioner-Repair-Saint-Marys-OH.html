By contrast, examining and replacing a furnace filter can usually be performed in simply a few minutes, frequently with no tools needed. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by numerous individuals.<p>
