<h3>HVAC Repair Companies in Blair NE 68008</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my organisations, my own homes and my realty clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is honest, trustworthy, and sensible on cost. It's difficult to find a sincere AC person and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
