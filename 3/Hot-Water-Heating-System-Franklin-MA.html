The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor impurities and assists exhaust them from the home.<p>
