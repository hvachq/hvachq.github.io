<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite considerable.<p>
