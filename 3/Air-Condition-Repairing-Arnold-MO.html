Contaminants might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering your house from the ground listed below. An air pollutant might also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or personal care products.
