They include hold-ups in physical and mental advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, kids, and babies are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than grownups because lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the damaging results of lead.
