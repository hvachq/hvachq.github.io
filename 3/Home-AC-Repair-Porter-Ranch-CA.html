However, direct exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible most of the times, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the released spores.

More severe than the majority of allergenic homes is the capability of mold to trigger episodes in persons that already have asthma, a serious breathing illness.<p>
