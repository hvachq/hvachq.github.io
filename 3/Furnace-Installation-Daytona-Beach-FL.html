<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely useful in collecting details on the phone and offering clear directions about how to briefly manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
<p>While pollutants typically found in indoor air are accountable for numerous damaging results, there is substantial uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of exposure are needed to produce specific health issue. People also react really in a different way to direct exposure to indoor air toxins. Further research is needed to much better understand which health impacts happen after exposure to the typical pollutant concentrations found in homes and which happen from the higher concentrations that happen for brief amount of times.<p>
<p>The predominant health impact connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
