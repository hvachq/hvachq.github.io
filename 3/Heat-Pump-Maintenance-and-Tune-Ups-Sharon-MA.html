<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to save energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to offer thermal convenience inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels inside your home.
