Purchased a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
