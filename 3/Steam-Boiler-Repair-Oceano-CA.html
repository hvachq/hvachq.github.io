<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay.

Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion objective. HVAC entrepreneur must strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the very same in all other locations.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
