<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>
