<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
