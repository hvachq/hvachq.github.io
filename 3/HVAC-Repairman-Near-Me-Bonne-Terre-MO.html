<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Bonne Terre MO</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heater need relatively little attention. But, just like any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is important to keep the system working smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of conventional water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank must be looked for leakages, the system must be flushed occasionally to remove tank and collected impurities (scaling in tough water locations).

The collector's glass can be washed periodically to eliminate dust gathered in order to improve collector effectiveness.<p>

That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has a possibility to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
