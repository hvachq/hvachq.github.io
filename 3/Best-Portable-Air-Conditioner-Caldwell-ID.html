<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to offer adequate changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common element essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
