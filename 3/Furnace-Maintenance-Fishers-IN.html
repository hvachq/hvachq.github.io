<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat.

The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather significant.<p>
