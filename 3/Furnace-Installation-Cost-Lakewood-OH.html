<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
