<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil.
