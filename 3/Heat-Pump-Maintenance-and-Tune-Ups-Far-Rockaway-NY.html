<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
