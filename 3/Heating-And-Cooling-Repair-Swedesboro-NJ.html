<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an option for property owners to think about. Often times, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, because the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are usually only available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best option for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
