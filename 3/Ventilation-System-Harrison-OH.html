<p>The split system is the most common. Many people are utilized to seeing this key in the yards of homes. With split system units, most of the parts are housed in a metal box beyond the house. However, there are some internal parts too. Split systems are ideal for cooling several rooms at the same time, but are not extremely energy efficient.
