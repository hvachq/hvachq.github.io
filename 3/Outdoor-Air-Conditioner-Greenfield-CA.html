<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating equipment can last for several years. However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel costs unexpectedly appear greater than typical, it is most likely time to think about a brand-new system. New heating devices is far more effective-- you'll see lower fuel costs immediately, not to discuss the cash you'll save money on repair costs. You can most likely expect to cut your fuel expenses in half if your heating system is 25 years old or more.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan.

Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>
