<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in Hendersonville NC 28792</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
