We had acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioning system before you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had methods to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
