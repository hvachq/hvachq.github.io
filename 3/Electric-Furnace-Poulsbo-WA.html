<p>If the AC does not shut off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur over time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
