<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the potential to adversely affect your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, germs, and really little particles of dust.

Insulation might be a more effective option to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>
<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio.
