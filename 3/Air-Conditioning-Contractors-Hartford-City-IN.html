<h3>Furnace Installation Cost in Hartford City Indiana</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, but to have 2 significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice prior to work started.

<p>Old lead-based paint is the most substantial source of lead exposure in the U.S. today.
