<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate because it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
