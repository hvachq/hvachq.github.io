<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor in Great Barrington MA</h3>
<p>The icing issue ends up being much more serious with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heat pumps are commonly set up in tandem with a more traditional type of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heatpump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which requires to be correctly vented and cleaned from the furnace routinely. Change the filters regularly and have your ductwork cleaned because the soot builds up inside the ducts, reducing their effectiveness gradually. Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
