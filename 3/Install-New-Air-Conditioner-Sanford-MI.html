<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ might notice musty or undesirable odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
<p>Practically half of Americans use air fresheners at least once a week, and 34 percent usage candles or incense that regularly, our nationally representative study found. Approximately 40 percent rarely or never clean their humidifier or kitchen range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never ever cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can aggravate indoor air quality.<p>
