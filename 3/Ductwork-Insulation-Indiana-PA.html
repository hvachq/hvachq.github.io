<p>There is no simple answer, but many utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a better solution. If the present system has actually not sustained other major repairs, is in otherwise outstanding condition, and problems that resulted in the breakdown can be determined and remedied, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
<p>Consider possible results of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system. Follow the producer's instructions, specifically instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating unit correctly adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is generally an indication of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While a space heating unit remains in usage, open a door from the space where the heating system lies to the rest of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
