<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience periodic durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Shut off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work properly after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work totally unless you do this.<p>
