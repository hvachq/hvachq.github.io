<h3>How Can Air Heat Pump Works in Greenfield OH?</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
