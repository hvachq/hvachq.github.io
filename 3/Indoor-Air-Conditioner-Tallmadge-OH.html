<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed.

Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money can be found in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year.
