<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system.
