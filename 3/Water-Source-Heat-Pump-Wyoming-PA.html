<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from items or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might include unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
