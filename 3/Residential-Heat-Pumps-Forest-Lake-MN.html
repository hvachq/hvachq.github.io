<p>When installing over concrete slabs, we recommend using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when used in conjunction with underfloor heating by functioning as a very effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of enabling heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
