<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Most Midtown Houston Tx customers don't know why their HVAC unit is not working when they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request. The copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's more than likely your issue. The next action is to thaw your air conditioning equipment if you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing. The easiest way to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the system off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>As discussed above, triggering your new under tile floor heater too soon, before the mortar has actually cured, can trigger the grout to crack or to not adhere effectively, and may void the service warranty of your mortar item. In some screening, even the tile broken when the system was run prior to the compound had cured. If you do not follow their instructions, and mortar manufacturers might refuse service warranty protection.<p>
