<p>Heaters are like cars. As they age, you can change one part just require another part replaced or repaired next year. It does not take long to invest $500 simply to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Furnaces incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives.

Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the house. A small home, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too quickly and shut off for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
