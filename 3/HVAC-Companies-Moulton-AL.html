<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an unusually high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had identified the trouble location in looking over the costs. He fixed the issue in one day, had adjusted the costs to what I thought about reasonable prior to he called back, understood what may have triggered the problem and had a plan to guarantee that it would not take place again. I have thought about All Points a company with stability for the nine years we have actually used them. This experience verifies that.<p>
