Start by opening the heat registers and then proceed to checking the thermostat settings. Next, inspect the furnace power, reset the furnace or examine the service door cover. You can also check the filter to make sure it is clear of dirt and check the standing pilot light to ensure it is lit.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as developing products, furnishings, and home products like air fresheners, release toxins more or less constantly. Other sources, associated to activities carried out in the house, release pollutants periodically. These include cigarette smoking, using malfunction-ing or unvented stoves, heating systems, or area heaters, the use of solvents in cleaning and pastime activities, using paint strippers in refurnishing activities, and making use of cleaning items and pesticides in house cleaning. High contaminant concentrations can stay in the air for extended periods after some of these activities.<p>
