<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts decades, since it is protected indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical standards get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
