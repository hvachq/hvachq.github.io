<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. Connection problems along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the performance of the unit. Loose, faulty or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and disrupt service. Part of keeping your furnace includes checking the recommended connections along with temperature and pressure determines. Take some time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are safe and tight.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the standard hot water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are accessible if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. It is most likely that it is supported by the plumbing if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have actually to be cut.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
