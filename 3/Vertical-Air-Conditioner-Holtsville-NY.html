<h3>Heating And Cooling Services in Holtsville NY 11742</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
