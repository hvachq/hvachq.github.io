<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as simply glowing systems.

When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

While doing so, heat is taken in from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For example, humans breathe out carbon dioxide, which in small amounts is not hazardous, but may end up being hazardous if high concentrations are enabled to accumulate. Bacteria or micro-organisms might likewise be present within the ventilation system.
