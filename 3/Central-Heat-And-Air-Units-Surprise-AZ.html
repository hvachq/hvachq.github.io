<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
