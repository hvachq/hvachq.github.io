Poorly located outdoor air intake vents can likewise generate air polluted with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological impurities that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning system, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>
