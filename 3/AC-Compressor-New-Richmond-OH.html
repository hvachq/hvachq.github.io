<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
