<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor system rather of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>While many average property owners can manage basic air filter cleaning or changing, calling a local, qualified HVAC system expert for regular furnace service and devices checks can assist ensure reliability and longevity, and in many cases prevent bigger concerns from developing.

<p>If the AC does not shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't release heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen with time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to work till you buy a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside must be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
