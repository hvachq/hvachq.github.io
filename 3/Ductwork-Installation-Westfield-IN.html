<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a referral later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
