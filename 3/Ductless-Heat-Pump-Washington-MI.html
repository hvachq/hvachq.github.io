<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure.
