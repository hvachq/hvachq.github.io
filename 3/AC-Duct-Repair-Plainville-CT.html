<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based only on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few reasonable ones received. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was considerate of my home and installed the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up examination outcomes look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 system it changed (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>Installation involves digging deep holes or long trenches to install the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. Nevertheless, you'll conserve money over the long term because of the lower energy expenses. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as conventional air-source units. The lack of moving parts indicates you're less most likely to invest big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're substantially more efficient then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
