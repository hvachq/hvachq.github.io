<p>A health survey need to be developed and distributed to all concerned workers. Such a tool must determine the variety of people impacted; define ages and job descriptions of involved employees; figure out where they are located within the office; suggest when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and season); offer a list of particular health symptoms or illnesses; recognize all makers run in the work environment; show the kind of outdoors air pollution; and recognize possible sources of task stress.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, search for signs of problems with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can indicate your house might not have adequate ventilation consist of wetness condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or smelly air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other items end up being musty. To detect odors in your house, action outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether smells are visible.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to offer enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A typical aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
