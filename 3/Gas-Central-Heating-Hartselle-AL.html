<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor unit as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work.

He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
