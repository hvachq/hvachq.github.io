<p>If your furnace has actually just passed away in sub-zero temperature levels or your air conditioning unit has actually gone kaput on a sweltering day, you'll probably be pleased to employ the first repairman who concerns your house that day.

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough job that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps people working. When a sales guy pertains to your home he exists to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and should not "need" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I provide you the choices for your needs and you decide if you require it.<p>
