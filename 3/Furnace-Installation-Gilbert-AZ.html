<p>The function of the majority of building ventilation systems is to generate sufficient fresh air for resident convenience while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing security at affordable energy expenses. Load calculating is described as the Handbook J computation and need to be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to offering an installation or system cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square video alone.

<p>For instance, issues develop when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to generate sufficient amounts of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation also occurs if the air supply and return vents within each room are obstructed or put in such a way that outside air does not actually reach the breathing zone of structure residents. Incorrectly located outside air consumption vents can also generate air infected with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading biological contaminants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>

Routine examination and maintenance also helps keep it in excellent shape and prolongs its life.<p>
