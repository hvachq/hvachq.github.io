<p>The rest of the HVAC system likewise needs to be in top condition for the a/c to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which live inside the home.

<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run.

That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down prior to it has an opportunity to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
