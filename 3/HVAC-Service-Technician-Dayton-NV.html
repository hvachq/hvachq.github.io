<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- provide All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work extremely well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Running on electricity, a heat pump is a cost-efficient solution utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, however in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air already inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air exterior and pushes it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned routinely, they can become clogged with particles that can restrict airflow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Dirty filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases cause the system to close down completely. By comparison, checking and changing a furnace filter can normally be done in simply a couple of minutes, typically without any tools required. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
