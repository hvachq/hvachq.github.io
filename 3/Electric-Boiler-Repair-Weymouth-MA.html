<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outside  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Strategy how you will expand your customer base over the years to stay lucrative, although at first, you might begin your HVAC company with limited threat.

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Since it exhausts warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it. Any airflow constraint will reduce the system's efficiency. You can, nevertheless, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
<p>These people have actually been excellent. At a real estate agent, I sometimes need contractors to give me a viewpoint for what work on a home may cost. Recently I needed to call on these men twice. They came out quickly and offered me a no nonsense price quote for the work.

Integrity isn't simply their name, it's a service model they take seriously. You men are officially on speed dial. Speak with you soon.<p>
