<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Choosing the best size central air system for your house is extremely crucial, as is picking either a package system, which keeps condenser, fan and coil all in one unit, or a split system, which positions the condenser outside the house and the fan and coil inside.
