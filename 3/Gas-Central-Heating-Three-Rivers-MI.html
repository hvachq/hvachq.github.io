<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't produce heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place in time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
