<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't produce heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place in time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts.

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
