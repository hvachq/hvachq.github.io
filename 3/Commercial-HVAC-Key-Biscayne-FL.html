<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, but it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite considerable.<p>

Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
