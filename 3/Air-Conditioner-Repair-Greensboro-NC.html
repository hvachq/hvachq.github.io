<p>The world's leading all-in-one software for residential and commercial HVAC companies. HVAC professionals go through a variety of potentially hazardous conditions. Service technicians are often required to work in cramped areas, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofing systems of houses. They can be exposed to unfavorable weather for long periods of time. Because they are called to structures without operating climate control, they are likewise subject to the extreme hot or cold temperature levels existing inside a place.<p>
<p>A split air conditioning system includes 2 main parts - a compressor situated outside and an inside air outlet system.

Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.
