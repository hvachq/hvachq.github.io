Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other elements that can impact this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

<p>These concepts-- and desire to suffer through the heat-- might already be changing. Though just 33 percent of Seattle housing units had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 new housing units have actually been integrated in the 4 years since or are currently under building.

So, make certain to change your AC filters regularly, or get an air conditioning service strategy which usually consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
