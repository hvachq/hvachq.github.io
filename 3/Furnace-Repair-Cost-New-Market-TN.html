While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, since a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
