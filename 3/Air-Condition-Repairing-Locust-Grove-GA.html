<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c unit back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s below the box to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were popular in the first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial structures, apartment buildings and huge residences. Lots of steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago remain operable, due to the fact that the lack of moving parts makes them less susceptible to use and tear. A steam boiler replacement costs in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
