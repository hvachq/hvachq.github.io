We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets.

<h3>Locating Greatest HVAC Contractors in Maitland FL</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
