There have actually been uncomfortable noises. I got it checked and repaired. I am hoping that is the end of the problem. Overall, it has actually been a great experience. Reputable on the whole. Cool operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its appearances in the beginning. But then understood ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to safeguard your financial investment by only using the services of a licensed contractor or a qualified representative from a company or retailer to do the installation.

A voided guarantee will not do you any great should the system fail or malfunction. Do it right from the beginning and hire a certified individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
