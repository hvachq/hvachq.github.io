<p>Excellent service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very thorough in describing what services would be carried out. Also Camryn provided excellent customer support at the end of the consultation by describing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater.

<p>As much of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment maker's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in location. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is typically hard to measure, as one reaction mentioned the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit don't just break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the outcome of recurring use of a component that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early degeneration, causing cracks and holes. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the element.  a very advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
