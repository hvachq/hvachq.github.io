<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power must not exceed the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, because the overall capacity of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outside unit. Put simply, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that a few of the rooms might not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not easy, because it considers not just the small power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>We take a look at clues prior to we supply recommendations to replace instead of repair a heating system. Among the hints we look at is the cost of energy.
