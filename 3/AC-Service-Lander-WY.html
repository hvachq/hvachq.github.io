<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, much of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each space. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
