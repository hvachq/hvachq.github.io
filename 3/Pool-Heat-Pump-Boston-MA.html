<p>Immediate results may appear after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such instant effects are usually short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is just removing the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Signs of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also appear not long after direct exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a home heating unit, you may try to find a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capacity and performance. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to look for a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. Fortunately is that the one significant disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or extremely hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
