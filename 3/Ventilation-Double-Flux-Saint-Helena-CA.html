<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer.

Part of preserving your furnace involves inspecting the advised connections in addition to temperature and pressure gauges. Take some time to examine these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are protected and tight.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan.

Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Image 6).<p>

<p>The primary health impact associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
