<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces are generally not really efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but many do not accomplish a performance greater than 90%. A few high-end brands have a performance of 95% by using a condenser. These are more pricey, having beginning expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation as well since a drain needs to be installed.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from inside your home and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
