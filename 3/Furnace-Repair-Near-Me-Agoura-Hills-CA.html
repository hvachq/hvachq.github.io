<h3>Advantages Of Hiring AC Repair Services at Agoura Hills CA</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
