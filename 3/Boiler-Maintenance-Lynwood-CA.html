<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be severe. They include hold-ups in physical and psychological development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, children, and infants are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups given that lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead. Kids may have higher exposures considering that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
