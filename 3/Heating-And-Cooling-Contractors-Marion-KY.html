<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years back and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.
