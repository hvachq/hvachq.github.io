<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must watch out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
