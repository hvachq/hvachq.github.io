<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either since of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my services, my own houses and my property customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and various problems that didn't make any sense.

However, choose your contractor carefully, a number of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the very same).

<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, frequently referred to as central air" or split-system air conditioning", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, floorings, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the ac system to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
