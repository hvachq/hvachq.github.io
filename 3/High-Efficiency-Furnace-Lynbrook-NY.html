<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have built-in delay features. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>PE firms tend to run with the goal of selling or spinning off a firm eventually. This might be through a public offering, a sale to a big organisation in the field, and even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management.
