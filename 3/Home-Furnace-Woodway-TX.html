The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>We advise using our insulation boards when setting up over concrete pieces. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by serving as a really efficient thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of allowing heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more challenging to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
