<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>House owners may also presume that because a glowing floor heating system can be seen (and financed) as a home enhancement, its installation will immediately raise their house's value. No proof exists suggesting that in-floor heating either positively or negatively impacts residential or commercial property worths. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the yearly Cost vs. Value Report released by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Renovation Magazine. Possibly Realtors should consider too many variables to definitively state what a radiant heat system may add to, or subtract from, any offered asking rate. That said, property buyers seeking to go green," who prioritize energy cost savings, or who absolutely want an in-floor heater will want to pay a premium for a home that includes one.<p>
