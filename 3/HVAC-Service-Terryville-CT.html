<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
