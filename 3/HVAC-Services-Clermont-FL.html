<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside system as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
