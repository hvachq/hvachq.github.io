That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down prior to it has an opportunity to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
