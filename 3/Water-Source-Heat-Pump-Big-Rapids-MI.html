<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut down totally.<p>
