<h3>Maximizing the Performance of Your HVAC System in Fennville MI</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in house building and construction is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, floorings, and roofing systems. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
