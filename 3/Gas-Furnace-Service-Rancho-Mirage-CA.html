<h3>Electric Boiler Repair in Rancho Mirage California</h3>
<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of visible growth or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Leaking return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Some health results may show up shortly after a single exposure or duplicated direct exposures to a pollutant. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such instant results are generally short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is just getting rid of the person's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Soon after direct exposure to some indoor air toxins, signs of some diseases such as asthma may appear, be exacerbated or intensified.<p>
