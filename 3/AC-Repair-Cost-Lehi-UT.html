<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Lehi UT</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
