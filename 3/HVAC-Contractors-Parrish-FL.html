<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank.
