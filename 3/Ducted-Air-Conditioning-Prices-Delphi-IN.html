This step is important so the system isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the very same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking equipment will send the sensing unit data to the cloud, where you can access it through software. You get immediate, real-time access to the monitoring results by means of a dashboard, which turns the information into visual charts that are simple to analyze.<p>
