They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they had to order it. My other half stated that she had seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most decent people I have fulfilled in a very long time. If we wish to have options to ACME heating, we require to support the real individuals who are there for us. Please do.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
