<p>Professional heater setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists suggest following this basic guideline when choosing whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost majority the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new.
