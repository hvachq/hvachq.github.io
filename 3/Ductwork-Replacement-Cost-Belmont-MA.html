This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical product in time.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
