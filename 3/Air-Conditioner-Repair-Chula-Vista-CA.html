Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not simply with newbies more accustomed to AC living.

Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors ought to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight.
