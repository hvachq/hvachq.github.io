<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>In a location where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good main heating unit. You'll wish to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing. Your heating technician can install controls which immediately shut down the heat pump if temperatures reach and drop listed below freezing. The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>
<p>HVAC coils normally give you a great 15-20 years of life before they start developing refrigerant leakages. Refrigerant leakages aren't the only problem cooling coils have.

The overall operating refrigerant pressures will increase drastically, causing your HVAC systems oil, compressor, & capacitor to breakdown quicker.<p>
