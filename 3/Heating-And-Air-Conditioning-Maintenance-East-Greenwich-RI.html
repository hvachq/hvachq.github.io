Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less efficient, but work reasonably well. Carpets will directly insulate the flooring from the space, reducing efficiency, so if you wish to set up carpet in a radiant-heated space, utilize a thin carpet with thick cushioning.<p>
<p>Air conditioners can develop a great deal of water due to the fact that they remove wetness from the air.
