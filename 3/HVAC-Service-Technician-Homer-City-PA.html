<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
