If you have actually installed the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in gathering information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to temporarily deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and provided clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
