<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>If the AC does not shut off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not emit heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur over time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
