<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, a number of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
