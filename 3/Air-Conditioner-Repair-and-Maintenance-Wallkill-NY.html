<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a referral in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
