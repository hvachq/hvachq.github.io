<p>At present, EPA does not suggest utilizing air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay products.

<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air.

However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, people breathe out co2, which in small quantities is not harmful, but may end up being dangerous if high concentrations are permitted to accumulate. Micro-organisms or bacteria may also exist within the ventilation system. They might spread out throughout the whole workplace or structure by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
