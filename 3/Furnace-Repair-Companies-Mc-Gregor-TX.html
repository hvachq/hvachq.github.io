<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
