<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Style, Building and Commissioning is created for architects, style engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other experts interested in indoor air quality. Our professionals discuss all of your choices before starting the repair, so you can choose whether a repair or replacement is best for you. Our No Surprises Pricing-- consisting of charging by the job, not by the hour-- suggests the rate we quote you is the rate you pay. If you decide that replacing your furnace is the very best strategy, we can install a new, high-efficiency design in its location.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system components, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>
