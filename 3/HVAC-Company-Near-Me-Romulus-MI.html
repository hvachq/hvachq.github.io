<h3>Hot Water Heating System in Romulus MI 48174</h3>

<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
