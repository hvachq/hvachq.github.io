<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roofing system, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, but it is also an option for house owners to consider. Many times, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are great for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, given that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are generally only available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity.
