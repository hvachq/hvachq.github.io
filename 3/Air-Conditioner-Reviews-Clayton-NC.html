<h3>Facts All Homeowners Must Know About HVAC Installation in Clayton NC</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  system rather of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
