<p>Make certain there are no carpets, furnishings, or anything else restricting the circulation of air.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to offer adequate changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this.
