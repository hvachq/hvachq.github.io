<p>The federal government suggests that houses be weatherized in order to minimize the amount of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, actions need to likewise be required to lessen pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.)

<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best feature of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S).

Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ may see musty or unpleasant odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse.

We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
