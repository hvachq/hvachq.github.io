<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
