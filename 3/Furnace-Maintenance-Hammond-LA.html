<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
