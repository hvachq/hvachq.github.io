<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should look out for. First, you must examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
