<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not offer them.. Second of all like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the unit has been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
