<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you ought to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
