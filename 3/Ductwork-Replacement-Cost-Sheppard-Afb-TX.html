<p>The bureau tasks 34 percent work growth for HVAC professionals in between 2010 and 2020, more than twice the average for all professions. Numerous elements add to this, including the replacement and upgrade of older cooling systems to meet more stringent environmental policies. The slow rebound in residential and commercial building will produce a constant circulation of new opportunities, specifically for professionals who are willing to move.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, but it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative effect on residents-- outdoors air must be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
