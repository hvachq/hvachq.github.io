<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
