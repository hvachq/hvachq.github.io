Indoor air pollution studies have determined a number of impurities that can be present in indoor air.

<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, given that some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>

There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this.
