<h3>Solar Heating System in South Jordan UT 84095</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most inexpensive. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
