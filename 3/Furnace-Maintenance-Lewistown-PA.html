<h3>Facts All Homeowners Must Know About HVAC Installation in Lewistown PA</h3>
<p>Even newer heating systems less than five years old have been found as bad. Too many house owners are stunned to learn that their 'brand-new' furnace  heat exchanger. In some cases it is due to poor furnace style, but in many cases, it's from neglect.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
