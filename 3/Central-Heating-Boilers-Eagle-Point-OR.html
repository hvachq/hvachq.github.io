<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
