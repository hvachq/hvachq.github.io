Heaters that kick on often might be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
