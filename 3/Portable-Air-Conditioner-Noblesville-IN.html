<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works but your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. Since it simply takes more electrical power to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off prior to it has a possibility to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In fact, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
