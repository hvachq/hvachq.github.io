According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>

The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled.
