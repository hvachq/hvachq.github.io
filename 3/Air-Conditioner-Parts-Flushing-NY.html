Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same).

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to offer adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A common element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
