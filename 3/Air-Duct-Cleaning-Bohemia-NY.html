The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 ought to be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements used for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
