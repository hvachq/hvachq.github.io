<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you ought to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
