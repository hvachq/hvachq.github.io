<p>Most well and city water does not usually include lead. Water typically gets lead inside the house from home plumbing that is made with lead products. The only way to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it tested. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to find out how to get the water tested. Send out for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to learn more about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to find out more.<p>
<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals emitted as gases from procedures or items; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
<p>For example, Provider has actually presented its Unfavorable Air Maker for health centers that it says cleans up contaminated air and prevents it from infecting various sections of a medical facility. Senseware, an intelligent building start-up known for air quality monitoring, released an option plan in partnership with other suppliers to help clients safely resume their businesses. Molekule, a residential air cleanser start-up, launched a brand-new item, now for healthcare usage, and got a FDA 510( k) Class II Medical Gadget Clearance.<p>
