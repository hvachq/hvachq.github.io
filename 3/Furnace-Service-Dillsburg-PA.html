<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price great but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced.
