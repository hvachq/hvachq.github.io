<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. In time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from indoors and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to look out for. First, you should check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
