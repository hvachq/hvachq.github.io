<p>Chemical toxins: Volatile natural compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are various, varied, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally happening chemical compounds. Chemical pollutants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the structure (e.g., workplace devices; furniture, wall and floor coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
