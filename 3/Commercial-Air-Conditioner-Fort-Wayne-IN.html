<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
