<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on.

<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can pay for, a lot of Seattleites should find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
