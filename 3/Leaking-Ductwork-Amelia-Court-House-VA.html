<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
