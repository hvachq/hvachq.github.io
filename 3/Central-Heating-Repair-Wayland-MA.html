Before we design and set up any systems, we arrange a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will advise enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these enhancements. Basic improvements usually include adding insulation and air sealing measures. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can recommend several certified house Energy Star auditors and installation specialists. Please Contact Us for references.<p>
