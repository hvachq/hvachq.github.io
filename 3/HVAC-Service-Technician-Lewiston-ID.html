They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy.

The outside condenser unit also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
