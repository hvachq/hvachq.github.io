<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a very enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase extra things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
