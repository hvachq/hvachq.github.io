The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most affordable if your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
