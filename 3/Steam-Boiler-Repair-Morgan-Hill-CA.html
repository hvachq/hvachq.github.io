<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up.

An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

Throughout high use months, check the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
