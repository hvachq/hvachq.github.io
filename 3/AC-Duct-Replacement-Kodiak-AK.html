<p>Numerous commercial buildings utilize mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that become part of the heating and HVAC systems. Some structures can also utilize natural ventilation by opening doors or windows.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have a negative impact on occupants-- outside air should be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
