<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c increase. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
