<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that allow greater air flow from the outdoors, air quality monitoring platforms and sensing units, and new air purification innovations are ending up being more common as readily available options in residential and commercial HVAC product packages.
