<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity specialist at a large merchant who asked not to be called due to the fact that he did not have consent to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a team that consistently keeps an eye on energy consumption and temperatures in stores to save money on expenses (particularly in the evening) and to alert shop supervisors if temperature levels in the shops change outside of an appropriate range that could prevent consumers from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also may contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced on a regular basis may end up being clogged, reducing air flow circulation, quality, and volume.
