<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to appropriately service and the system has actually been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
