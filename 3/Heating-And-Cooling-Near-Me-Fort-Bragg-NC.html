<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as vital as a regular oil modification in your vehicle. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter better traps impurities and debris in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter.
