You can also examine the filter to ensure it is clear of dirt and examine the standing pilot burner to ensure it is lit.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. When the belt that links the motor to the blower slips, screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler generally happen.

<p>We take a look at clues prior to we supply advice to change instead of repair a heating system. Among the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we know the system is not running effectively. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be losing money by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>Some biological pollutants set off allergies, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Infectious diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Mildews and molds launch disease-causing toxic substances. Symptoms of health issue caused by biological contaminants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, lethargy, fever, and gastrointestinal issues.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system, think about possible results of indoor air contamination. Follow the producer's directions, especially directions on the proper fuel and keeping the heater correctly changed. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is normally a sign of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While a space heating unit is in use, open a door from the space where the heating unit is located to the remainder of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
