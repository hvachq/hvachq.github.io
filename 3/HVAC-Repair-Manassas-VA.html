<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside system as near to your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
