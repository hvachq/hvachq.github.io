<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to properly harden and treat-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
<p>As mentioned above, triggering your new under tile floor heating unit prematurely, before the mortar has treated, can cause the grout to crack or to not adhere effectively, and might void the guarantee of your mortar item. In some testing, even the tile broken when the system was run before the substance had actually treated. If you do not follow their instructions, and mortar producers might decline warranty protection.<p>
