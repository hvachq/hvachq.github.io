<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
