<p>When our furnace was passing away, we contacted two local companies for bids. While both were useful and informative, Ballard Gas provided us a better offer, for remarkable service. Instead of an easy sales job, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heating system and situated ways we might have more even heat. He included these significant but small modifications in his bid. We decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump due to the fact that of recent warmer summertimes and for ecological reasons.<p>
