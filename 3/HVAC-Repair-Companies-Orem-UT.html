They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

Because the energy utilized to heat your house is drawn out directly from the ground, it secures the environment from damaging digging, fracking, or pollutants. Geothermal systems utilize compressor and evaporator systems comparable to those used in refrigerators. While geothermal systems do use some electrical power, they release far less greenhouse gases or other contaminants than heating systems that require natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
