<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power needs to not exceed the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units higher than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, because the overall capacity of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outside system. Put simply, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that a few of the spaces might not have a really comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the overall power is not basic, considering that it takes into consideration not only the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
