<p>While contaminants frequently found in indoor air are accountable for lots of damaging results, there is substantial unpredictability about what concentrations or periods of exposure are required to produce particular illness. People likewise react really differently to exposure to indoor air contaminants. Additional research is needed to much better understand which health impacts happen after direct exposure to the typical pollutant concentrations discovered in homes and which occur from the higher concentrations that take place for brief time periods.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
