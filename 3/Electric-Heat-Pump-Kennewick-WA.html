<h3>Central Heating Installation Agency in Kennewick WA</h3>
<p>Many people are aware that outdoor air contamination can impact their health, however indoor air contamination can likewise have considerable, hazardous impact. EPA research studies of human direct exposure to air toxins suggest that indoor levels of pollutants might be 2 to five times-- and sometimes more than 100 times-- higher than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air contamination among the leading 5 environmental health risks to the general public.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
