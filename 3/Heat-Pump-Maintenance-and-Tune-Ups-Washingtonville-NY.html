<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Great Item! Delivery was kind of weird being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets.

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a regular oil modification in your automobile. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and particles in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. During high use months, examine the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>

<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump systems can have various heating and cooling capabilities. If you currently have a home heating unit, you might look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and effectiveness. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to look for a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one significant drawback of heatpump is that they can stop working in the exceptionally hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
<p>Watch out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days may end up being a source for mold growth and should be discarded. Sometimes there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in surprise or rarely accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, chances are there will be mold growing close by. Repair the wetness issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the area utilizing recognized health department recommendations.<p>
