<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Vital Business in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are ranked 90% efficiency or much better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient.

<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a large central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your house. Heat pumps run on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may go into close-by ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
