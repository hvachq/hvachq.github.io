<p>Air conditioning system producers typically make rugged, high quality items. If your a/c unit stops working, start by checking any merges or circuit breakers. Let the system cool down for about 5 minutes prior to resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch may have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, situated in the compressor's access panel.<p>

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
