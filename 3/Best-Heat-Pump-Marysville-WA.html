Permeable materials, ceiling, wall, and flooring coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to 2 days may end up being a source for mold development and need to be discarded.

If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, chances are there will be mold growing nearby. Repair the moisture issue, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely tidy the area using recognized health department suggestions.<p>
