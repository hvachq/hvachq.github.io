Basically, the outside system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that some of the rooms might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not simple, since it takes into account not just the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
