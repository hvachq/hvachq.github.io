<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't offer off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place in time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
