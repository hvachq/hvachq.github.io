<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
