<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run because it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. Since it merely takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to run. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
