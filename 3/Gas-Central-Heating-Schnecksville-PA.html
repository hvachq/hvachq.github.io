<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
