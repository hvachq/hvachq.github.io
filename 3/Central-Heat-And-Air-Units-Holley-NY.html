Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
