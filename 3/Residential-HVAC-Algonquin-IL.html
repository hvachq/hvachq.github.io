<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity specialist at a big merchant who asked not to be named because he did not have consent to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a group that regularly keeps an eye on energy usage and temperature levels in stores to minimize costs (especially in the evening) and to alert shop managers if temperatures in the stores change outside of an appropriate range that could avoid consumers from shopping at the store.<p>

He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour.

I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
