<h3>Appropriate Things To Look Out For In Your El Dorado AR Commercial HVAC Service Provider</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
