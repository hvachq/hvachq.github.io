<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as important as a regular oil modification in your car. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter better traps contaminants and particles in the air. Energy Star advises changing your filter as soon as every three months. During high usage months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood simply what the problem was and fixed it really quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
