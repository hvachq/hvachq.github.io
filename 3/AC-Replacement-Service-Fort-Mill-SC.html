<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
