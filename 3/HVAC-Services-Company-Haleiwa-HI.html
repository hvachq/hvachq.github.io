<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil.

Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the problem.<p>
