The average daytime temperature level highs during December, January, and February variety from the mid-40s to low-50s.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
