<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Central Falls RI?</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>

Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
