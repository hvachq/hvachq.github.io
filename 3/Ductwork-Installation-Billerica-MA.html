He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He provided to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most decent people I have actually fulfilled in a long period of time.

<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
