<p>Buildings are created or meant to respond actively to a few of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sterilize, and preserve surfaces to enhance their efficiency, durability, or look. In other cases, such modifications subtly or even considerably change structures in ways that may be important to their own stability or their effect on structure occupants through the advancement of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time. We may discover it helpful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, especially, a few of the techniques used by scientists studying ecosystems, in order to get an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we invest the majority of our time, our buildings.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
