<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of heaters have multiple control boards. The biggest, or just one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel must be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t properly diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a professional to identify.<p>
