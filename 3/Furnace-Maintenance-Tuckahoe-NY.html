Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked.

Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>

<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx consumers don't know why their HVAC unit is not working when they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair request. The copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's more than likely your issue.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
