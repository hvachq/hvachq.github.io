<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Spring Lake NJ</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the math recently, but I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be appropriately vented and cleaned from the furnace frequently. Modification the filters regularly and have your ductwork cleaned because the soot builds up inside the ducts, lowering their efficiency in time. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
