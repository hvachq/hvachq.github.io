<p>Professional heater installations. However, even the best-maintained heating unit will ultimately stop working. HVAC experts suggest following this standard guideline when deciding whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's finest to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
