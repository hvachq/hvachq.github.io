<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do decline them up until they have been correctly dried.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that ideal temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those common air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can cause costly repairs down the road. So, make sure to change your AC filters routinely, or get an air conditioning service plan which normally includes a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
