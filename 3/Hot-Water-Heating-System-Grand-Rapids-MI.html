<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
