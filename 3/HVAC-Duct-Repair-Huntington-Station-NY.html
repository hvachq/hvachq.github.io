<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor unit as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do not accept them till they have been correctly dried. Try a various dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
