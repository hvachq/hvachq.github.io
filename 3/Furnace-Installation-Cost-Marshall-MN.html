A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location.

Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the home. A little house, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too quickly and shut down for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
