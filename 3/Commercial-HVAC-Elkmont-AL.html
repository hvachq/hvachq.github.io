<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.<p>
