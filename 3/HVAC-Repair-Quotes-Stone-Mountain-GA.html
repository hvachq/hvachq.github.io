<p>After the system has been checked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
