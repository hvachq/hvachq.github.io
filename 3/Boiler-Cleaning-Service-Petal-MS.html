<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
