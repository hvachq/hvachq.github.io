<p>Many commercial buildings use mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that belong to the heating and HVAC systems. Some structures can also make use of natural ventilation by opening windows or doors. The ventilation rate" is the amount of outside air introduced into an area per an unit of time, and is frequently revealed in cubic feet per minute (cfm).

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 ought to be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements used for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
