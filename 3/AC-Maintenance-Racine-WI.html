<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that just a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a property owner doesn't have the tools or skills necessary to examine refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and appropriate air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the essential devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician check the system periodically.<p>
<p>Heating is also among the greatest energy consumers in your house, so property owners who might be looking for a brand-new furnace should thinking about replacing it with a newer, more energy-efficient design to save cash and help the environment. The typical furnace lasts between 15 and 20 years, so you're making a significant investment in your house. Invest carefully by finding out as much as you can about offered alternatives.<p>
