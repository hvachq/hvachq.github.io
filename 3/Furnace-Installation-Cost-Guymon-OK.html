<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

If you find the issue and have a washable filter, thereâ $ s no charge. Do It Yourself filter replacement options variety from $3 to $40, and you get what you spend for. That may be an extremely expensive dirty-filter medical diagnosis if the technician comes to your home. This sort of cleaning work should be performed in a regular basis, so a furnace tune-up is required, examine our Furnace Tune-Up Cost Guide to see its cost.<p>
