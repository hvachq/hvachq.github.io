<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

They fulfilled my needs totally by offering a professional quote with alternatives, without pushing additional items. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise quickly followed up with the essential assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
