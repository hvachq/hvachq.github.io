<p>Expert heating unit installations. However, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually fail. HVAC experts recommend following this basic rule when deciding whether it's worth buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
