<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
