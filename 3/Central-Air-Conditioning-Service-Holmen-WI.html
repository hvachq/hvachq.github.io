<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Iâ $ m actually picky with my things. I like my devices and appliances initial, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with low-cost knock-offs.

Am glad I got this however since it has restored my faith in great production. I havenâ $ t had an issue with this new Carrier I got considering that I bought it 7 months earlier. Itâ $ s just best.<p>
