<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
