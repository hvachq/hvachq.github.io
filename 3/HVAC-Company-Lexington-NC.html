<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The primary reason property owners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the quantity of services provided. The cost may not be rewarding if the system is new and still under a maker's warranty. Any major repairs must be covered under the maker's service warranty. However, some manufacturers require regular maintenance as a regard to the service warranty.<p>
