<p>I am changing our High Speed System since of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off contaminants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Start by checking out the installation handbook and familiarizing yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. Most systems come with a package that includes adjustable window extensions and metal installing brackets. These parts will make sure a protected and airtight  fit in the window opening. And for extra support, particularly for bigger a/c, think about acquiring a steel assistance bracket and mount it to the outdoors home wall, directly below the windowsill.<p>
