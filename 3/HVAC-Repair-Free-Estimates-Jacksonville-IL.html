<p>We're spending a lot more time inside your home, these days. While many individuals assume contamination is just an outside issue, your home (and office) can also be contaminated. As a society, we ensure that our houses are well-sealed and well-insulated, however we don't believe sufficient about exposure to all the important things we position in our homes," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a huge result on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- right away, they can begin years after exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
