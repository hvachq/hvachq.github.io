<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in Eatontown NJ - The Benefits</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very happy that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to test the air conditioner before you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to test AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>
