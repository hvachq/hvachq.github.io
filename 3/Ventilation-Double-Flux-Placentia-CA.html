<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed.

Instead of a basic sales task, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heater and located ways we might have more even heat. He included these significant but small adjustments in his bid. We chose to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump due to the fact that of current warmer summertimes and for environmental factors.<p>
<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard job that the employees sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.

You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and must not "need" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I give you the alternatives for your requirements and you decide if you require it.<p>
