<p>Firstly, The after hours answering service representative, John, was professional and extremely respectful. Second Of All, Gracion W is a timely, experienced technician. He was at my home within the time he offered me, fixed the issue while describing the issue then stayed a number of minutes to ensure it was working properly. The concern was repaired in a matter of time that I've never seen before while being a property owner for 10 years. I also suggest among the Security Plans, which I belong to, if you like to conserve cash. Thank you." Karen P.<p>

<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
