If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut down completely.<p>
