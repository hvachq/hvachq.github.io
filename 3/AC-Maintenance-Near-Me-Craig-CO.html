<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil.
