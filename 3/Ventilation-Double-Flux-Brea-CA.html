<p>Particular instant effects resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is frequently difficult to identify if the signs are a result of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is essential to focus on the time and place the signs take place. If the symptoms fade or go away when an individual is far from the home and return when the individual returns, an effort must be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes.
