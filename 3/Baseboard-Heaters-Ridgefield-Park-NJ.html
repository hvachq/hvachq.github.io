<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump units can have different heating and cooling capabilities. If you currently have a house heater, you might look for a heatpump more geared towards cooling capability and efficiency. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to look for a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one significant downside of heat pumps is that they can fail in the extremely hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
<p>Sometimes a temporary indoor air quality problem is created merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term fix may be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. However more complicated concerns-- determined by consistently undesirable air quality tracking results-- will need a various tack. Depending upon the concern you're experiencing, among the 3 methods below might be proper.<p>
