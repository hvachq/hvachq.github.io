<p>Truth: Geothermal systems really take in no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to ten years old, it might grovel twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would use. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to offer a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices installed just a few years back.<p>
