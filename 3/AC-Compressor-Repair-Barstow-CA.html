But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
