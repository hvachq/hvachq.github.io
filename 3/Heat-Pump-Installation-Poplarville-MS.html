<p>All homes require effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the appropriate temperature level. Heating systems that kick on regularly may be due to an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>
