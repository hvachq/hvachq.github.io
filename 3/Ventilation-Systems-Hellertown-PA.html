<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Photo 6).<p>

Nevertheless, because all elements of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is really heated up, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
