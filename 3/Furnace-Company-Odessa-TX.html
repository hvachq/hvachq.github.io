<p>I have been using them for several years for my businesses, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is honest, dependable, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to find a truthful AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
