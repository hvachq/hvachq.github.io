<p>Air toxins can vary from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your pets to unsafe gas leaks.

In cooking areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can become a problem where wetness levels are usually higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence occupants. Unlike other kinds of air conditioners, evaporative coolers rely on the outdoors air to be carried through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the within a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be enabled to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to understand and preserve.<p>
