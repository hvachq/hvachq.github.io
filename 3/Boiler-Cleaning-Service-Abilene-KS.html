<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for assessment and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. The likelihood of immediate responses to indoor air contaminants depends upon numerous factors including age and preexisting medical conditions.

By contrast, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can generally be done in simply a few minutes, frequently with no tools needed. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
