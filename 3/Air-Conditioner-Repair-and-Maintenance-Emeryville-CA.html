<h3>Ways to Get the Most out of Your HVAC System at Emeryville CA</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really happy that somebody as knowledgeable as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c before you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter. We want we had known him then.<p>
<p>An undersize unit will not have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate because it simply takes more electricity to run a larger system. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a possibility to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
