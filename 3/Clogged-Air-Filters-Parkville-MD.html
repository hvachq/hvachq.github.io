<p>The very first a/c and refrigerators employed harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could lead to deadly mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
