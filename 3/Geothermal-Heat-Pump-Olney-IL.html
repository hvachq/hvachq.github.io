<p>Just like the majority of house improvement projects, the cost of a full central heater can vary commonly based on the size of the house. The majority of furnaces will last between 15 and twenty years. In choosing a furnace, property owners should think about heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A small home, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too quickly and shut off for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
