<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned regularly, they can end up being obstructed with debris that can limit air flow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Filthy filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down completely. By comparison, examining and replacing a furnace filter can normally be performed in just a few minutes, often without any tools needed.
