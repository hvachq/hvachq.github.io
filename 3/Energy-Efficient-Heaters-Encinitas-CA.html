<h3>Heating Strategies For Gas Home Furnaces in Encinitas CA</h3>
<p>For entire home installations, it's difficult, if almost difficult, to retrofit a convected heat system in an existing home, particularly a hydronic system. Localized radiant floor heat systems to be used in one or several rooms like restrooms, kitchen areas or utility room are quickly renovated with electric radiant floor heat. This is much more affordable on a smaller scale. Larger remodellings like additions to a house might be suitable for a larger scale and more expensive hydronic system.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
