<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
