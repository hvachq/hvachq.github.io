<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with a very old name. The company started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for years, till the required for high-efficiency units forced Goettl to end production. The contracting side of business continued under several owners.

<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
