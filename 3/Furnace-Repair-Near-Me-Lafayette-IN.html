<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was really comprehensive and on-time in explaining what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn offered great customer support at the end of the consultation by describing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance jobs we may wish to have actually carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques used by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ may discover unpleasant or musty smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, however it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and structure tenancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have a negative effect on residents-- outside air needs to be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
