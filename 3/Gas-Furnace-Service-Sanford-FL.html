The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit resemble those of conventional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank should be looked for leakages, the system needs to be flushed occasionally to remove tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in tough water areas). The systems need to be examined at least two times annually for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed occasionally to eliminate dust collected in order to improve collector effectiveness.<p>

When the temperature level falls below a limit, both the fan and compressor are shut down to reduce additional temperature drops; clarification needed this avoids moisture on the evaporator from being blown back into the room. citation required When the temperature rises once again, information required the compressor restarts and the fan returns to low speed.<p>
