<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to offer enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A common element essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
