<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
