<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're probably hearing the fan motor trying to start without the increase it needs from the capacitor. You can often conclude that the capacitor has stopped working. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the chances are great that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's finest to replace the capacitor.<p>
<p>Whatever heating system you install, it's necessary that it's sized properly for your home. Too large and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should. Plus, it will use too much energy for the quantity of heat you desire produced. If the system is too small, then your home won't be heated sufficiently and the system will need to continuously go to attempt to heat the entire house, which will increase heating expenses.<p>
<p>Given that cooling and heating work might also need installing or repairing pipes to provide oil or natural gas to heating devices, an HVAC contractor might also be needed to hold a different plumbing's license or have a licensed plumber on call. However, some jurisdictions license HVAC contractors particularly for this kind of work. When getting a quote, be sure to ask not just if a company is certified, but also what type of license it holds.<p>
