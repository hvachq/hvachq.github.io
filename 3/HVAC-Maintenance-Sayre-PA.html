<h3>Air Condition Service in Sayre PA 18840</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
