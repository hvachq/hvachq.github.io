<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace specialists typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>To start with, The after hours responding to service representative, John, was professional and really polite. Second Of All, Gracion W is a timely, well-informed technician.
