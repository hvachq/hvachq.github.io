<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Necessary Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are rated 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which may be rated as low as 80% performance, this can imply substantial savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
