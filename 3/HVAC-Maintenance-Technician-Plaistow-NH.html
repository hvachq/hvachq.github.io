<h3>Maximizing the Efficiency of Your HVAC System at Plaistow NH</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Since an a/c moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both must be kept clean. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
