<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge contaminants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Consider prospective effects of indoor air pollution if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system. Follow the producer's instructions, specifically instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating unit appropriately adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is generally a sign of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heating unit is in usage, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the rest of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
