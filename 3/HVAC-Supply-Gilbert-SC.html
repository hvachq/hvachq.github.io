<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. Since it just takes more electricity to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
