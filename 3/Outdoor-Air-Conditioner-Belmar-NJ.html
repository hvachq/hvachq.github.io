<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside system as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Truth That You May Not Know About a Boiler Heating Method in Belmar NJ</h3>
<p>After residing in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the cooling. I went on and bought this Provider and I need to say it gets the job done quite well. It takes extremely little time to heat up or cool off your house which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t obtain from the one we had in the past. The unit hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
