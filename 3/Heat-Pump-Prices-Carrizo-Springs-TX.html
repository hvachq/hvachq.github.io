<h3>AC Repair Contractor in Carrizo Springs Texas</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
