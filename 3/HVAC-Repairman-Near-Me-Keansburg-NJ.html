<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
