<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Power Vac America provides commercial, commercial, institutional, marine and residential duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning services. The key portion of your air conditioning is the outside system. Without it, you have no cooling. Depending upon its placement on your residential or commercial property and its upkeep, it may sustain some damage during the winter. The majority of the time, this just includes some buildup of dirt and particles, which is pretty easy to remove. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will wipe the outside of the system and make sure that there is no rust, damage from accumulated wetness, or extreme wear to the exterior. They may advise that you trim overgrown trees or bushes to ensure sufficient airflow around the system.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control.
