<h3>Heat Ventilation in Marengo IL 60152</h3>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical product over time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
