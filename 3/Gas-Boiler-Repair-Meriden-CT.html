<h3>Emergency Furnace Repair in Meriden CT 06450</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The very best feature of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they detected the problem and fixed very rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business several years ago and know the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
