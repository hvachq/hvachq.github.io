<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them up until they have actually been properly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent gos to.<p>
