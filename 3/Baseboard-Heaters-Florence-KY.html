<p>Great Product! Shipment was sort of strange being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The product was incredibly lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we resolved issues. I would advise this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
