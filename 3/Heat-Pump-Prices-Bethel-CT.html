<p>I usually don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Filters can get dirty easily, especially if you reside in a place that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, debris, bacteria, and tidy the air. They're responsible for maintaining the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you expect it to if they're not cleaned up and changed routinely. The cooling and heating will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will intensify. Examining and altering the air filters is among the most essential aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>
