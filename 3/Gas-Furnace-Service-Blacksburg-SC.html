<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning an organisation was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end objective.
