<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
