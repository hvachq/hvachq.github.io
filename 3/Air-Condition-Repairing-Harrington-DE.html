<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
