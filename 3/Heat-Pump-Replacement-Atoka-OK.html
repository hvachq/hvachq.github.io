<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
