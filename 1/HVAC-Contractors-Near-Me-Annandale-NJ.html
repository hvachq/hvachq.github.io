<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to provide thermal comfort inside. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors develops the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities give rise to mold growth and wetness inside your home is associated with a greater frequency of resident breathing problems.<p>
<p>In more complex plans, warm air is allowed to flow and rise out high building openings to the outside (stack result ), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low structure openings. Natural ventilation schemes can utilize very little energy, however care should be required to make sure comfort. In warm or humid climates, keeping thermal convenience solely via natural ventilation might not be possible. Air conditioning systems are utilized, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers likewise utilize outside air to condition spaces, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and disperse cool outdoor air when appropriate.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical material over time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
