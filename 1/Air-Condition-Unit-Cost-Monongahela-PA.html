<p>I am changing our High Speed System since of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your house that best temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those common air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the road. So, be sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an air conditioning service plan which usually includes a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Consider possible effects of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system. Follow the producer's directions, especially directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater properly changed. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is typically an indication of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While a space heating unit remains in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit is located to the remainder of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
