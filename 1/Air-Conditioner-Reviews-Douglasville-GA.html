<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers pollutants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage performance rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A very effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the producer's instructions.<p>

<p>I have had the pleasure of working with Pro-Staff Mechanical, Inc. for nearly ten years and during that time, they have constantly provided exemplary service.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
