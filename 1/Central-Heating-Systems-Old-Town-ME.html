Winter season used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not simply with newbies more familiar with AC living. Longtime Seattle homeowners are finally giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.  Secondly like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to appropriately service and the system has been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
