<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>The installation was fast, expert and very well done. The installers were respectful and understood precisely what to do. I am an engineer by profession and acknowledge quickly people who are good at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are great and do not miss information that creates a job extremely well done. I extremely extremely advise the 2 gentlemen as they are outstanding at what they do. Thank you to them as they definitely deserve my thanks and gratitude for a job well done.<p>
