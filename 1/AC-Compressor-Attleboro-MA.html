<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Lead has long been recognized as a harmful toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " top ecological hazard to the health of children in the United States." There are many ways in which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Prior to it was known how harmful lead could be, it was utilized in paint, gas, water pipes, and lots of other items.<p>
<p>The installation was quickly, professional and very well done. The installers were polite and knew exactly what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and recognize easily people who are proficient at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are very good and do not miss detail that develops a task extremely well done.

<p>If the AC does not shut off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't produce heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must suffice till you buy a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure." Those procedures include generating outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
