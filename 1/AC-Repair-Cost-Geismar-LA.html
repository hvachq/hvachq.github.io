HVAC professionals suggest following this basic guideline when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost majority the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can register for a maintenance plan with your local heating and air conditioning company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance visits each year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and typically some other perks. Some companies provide priority consultations to their maintenance plan members.<p>
