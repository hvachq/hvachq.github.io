<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the very same pollutants.

<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
