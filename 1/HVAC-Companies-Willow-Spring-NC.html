<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden floor joist system, underneath the wooded subsurface and final flooring surface. This is usually utilized in a second or third-floor  area and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
