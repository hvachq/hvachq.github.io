<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx consumers do not know why their HVAC system is not working when they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request. The copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you require to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you remain in luck, that's most likely your issue. The next step is to defrost your air conditioning devices if you discovered that your conditioning filter requires replacing. The most convenient method to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
