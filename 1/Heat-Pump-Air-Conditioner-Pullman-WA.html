<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based just on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few affordable ones got. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install examination results look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 system it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
