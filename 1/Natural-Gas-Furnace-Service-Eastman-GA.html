<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was essential and renovated the whole plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater because the professionals believed they simply didn't appear ideal and they could not leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
