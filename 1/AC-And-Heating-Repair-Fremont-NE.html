<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide should be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements used for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
