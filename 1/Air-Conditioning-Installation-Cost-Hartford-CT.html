<h3>The Way to Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Hartford CT</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
