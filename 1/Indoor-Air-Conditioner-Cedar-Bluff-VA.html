Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less efficient, but work reasonably well. Carpeting will straight insulate the floor from the space, decreasing effectiveness, so if you wish to install carpet in a radiant-heated room, use a thin carpet with thick padding.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly.
