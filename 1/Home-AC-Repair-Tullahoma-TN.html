<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Needs in Tullahoma TN</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit need reasonably little attention. But, as with any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is vital to keep the system working smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit are similar to those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank should be checked for leakages, the system must be flushed periodically to remove tank and collected impurities (scaling in difficult water areas). The systems need to be checked a minimum of twice per year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed occasionally to get rid of dust gathered in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
