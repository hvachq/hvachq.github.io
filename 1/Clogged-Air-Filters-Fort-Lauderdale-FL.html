<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace specialists typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>
