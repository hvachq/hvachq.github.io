That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a possibility to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>

<p>This is especially notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>When your home's furnace quits working, your home can have more problems than simply being unpleasant.

<p>The primary health impact related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
