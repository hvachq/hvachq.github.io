The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>My eldest boy always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before.
