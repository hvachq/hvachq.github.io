<p>Some health impacts can be helpful indicators of an indoor air quality problem, specifically if they appear after an individual transfers to a brand-new home, remodels or refurnishes a house, or deals with a home with pesticides.

<p>I generally don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. In time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors altered to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>

<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems.
