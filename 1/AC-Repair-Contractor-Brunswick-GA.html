Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
