<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up.

A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

In addition, evaluation and testing of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to make certain it is working according to specifications for constructing use and tenancy) ought to be carried out.
