If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you require to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's probably your issue.

The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to private bed rooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
