<p>Central air units are determined in tons. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Iâ $ m really particular with my things. I like my equipment and devices original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with cheap knock-offs.

<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home residents. Unlike other kinds of ac system, evaporative coolers depend on the outdoors air to be carried through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the within a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be permitted to press the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to maintain and understand.<p>
