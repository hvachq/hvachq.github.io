<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance sees annually, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and generally some other advantages. Some companies provide priority visits to their maintenance strategy members.<p>

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists if no pollutant sources are discovered. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions.
