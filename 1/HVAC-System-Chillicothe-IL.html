Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated procedure. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather pricey.<p>
