<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  system instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor system. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Lots of elements impact IAQ. These aspects include poor ventilation (lack of outside air), issues managing temperature level, low or high humidity, recent remodeling, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air coming into the structure. In some cases, specific pollutants like dust from construction or renovation, mold, cleaning products, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (including small amounts of chemicals launched as a gas over time) may cause poor IAQ.<p>
