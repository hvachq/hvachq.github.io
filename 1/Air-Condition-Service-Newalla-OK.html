<p>Central air is a high-end not everyone can afford, so many Seattleites need to discover ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
