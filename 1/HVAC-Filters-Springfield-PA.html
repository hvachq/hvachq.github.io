<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx clients do not understand why their HVAC system is not working when they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil.
