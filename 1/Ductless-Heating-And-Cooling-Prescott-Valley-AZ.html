<p>Fact: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>

<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Prescott Valley AZ</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in house building and construction is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in floors, walls, and roofs. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air helps and dilutes indoor contaminants exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your air conditioning unit and heatpump need to be without all clogs and particles. Clogs can block the circulation of condensed water and trigger moisture build-up within the system. Excess moisture can trigger issues like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the home, irregular temperature policy, germs, and jeopardized air quality. An expert maintenance technician will clean up the condensate and flush drain to ensure all excess wetness flows away from the system.<p>
