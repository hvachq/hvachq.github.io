<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Services in Colchester</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace professionals frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were incredibly popular in the first half of the 20th century, specifically in commercial buildings, apartment buildings and very large residences. Many steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago stay operable, due to the fact that the lack of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to wear and tear. A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>
