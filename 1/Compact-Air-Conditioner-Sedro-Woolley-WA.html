<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide should be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be essential.<p>
