<h3>Furnace Installation in Fairbanks AK 99709</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
