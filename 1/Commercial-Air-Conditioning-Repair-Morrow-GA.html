<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not provide off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should work until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
