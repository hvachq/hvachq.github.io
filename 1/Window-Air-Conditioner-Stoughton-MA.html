<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
