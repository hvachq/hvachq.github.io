<p>Certain instant results are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often hard to identify if the symptoms are a result of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is very important to take notice of the time and place the symptoms occur. If the signs fade or go away when a person is far from the home and return when the individual returns, an effort should be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some effects may be intensified by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the cooling, heating, or humidity conditions prevalent in the home.<p>
<p>Our indoor air quality professionals can transform your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center.
