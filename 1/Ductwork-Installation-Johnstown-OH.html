<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
