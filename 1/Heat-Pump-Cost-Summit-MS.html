<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
