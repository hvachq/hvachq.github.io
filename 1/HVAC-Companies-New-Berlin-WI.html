<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as essential when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to correctly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by animals and individuals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can become airborne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
