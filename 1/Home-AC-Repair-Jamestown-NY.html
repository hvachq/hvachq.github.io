Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy.

The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
