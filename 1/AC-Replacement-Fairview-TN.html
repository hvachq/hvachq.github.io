<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
