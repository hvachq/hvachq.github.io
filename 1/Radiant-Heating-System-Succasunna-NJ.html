<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
