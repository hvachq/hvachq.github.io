The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Plan how you will expand your customer base throughout the years to stay lucrative, although at first, you might begin your HVAC service with minimal risk.
