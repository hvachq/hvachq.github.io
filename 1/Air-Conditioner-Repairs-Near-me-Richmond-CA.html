<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

Be sure to let him understand what you're experiencing, as this can assist him to detect the problem. He will then offer a fair estimate for repair.
