<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Must guidance not suffice, one of our techs will visit your Waukesha home or company to evaluate your system. Be sure to let him understand what you're experiencing, as this can assist him to detect the problem. He will then offer a fair estimate for repair. Once licensed, we'll quickly and efficiently perform the required fix.
