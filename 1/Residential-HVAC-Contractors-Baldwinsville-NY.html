<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>

In this case, the control system is really important to keeping an appropriate temperature.<p>
