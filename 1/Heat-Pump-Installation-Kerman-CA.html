<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was essential and renovated the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater due to the fact that the service technicians thought they just didn't seem ideal and they couldn't leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
