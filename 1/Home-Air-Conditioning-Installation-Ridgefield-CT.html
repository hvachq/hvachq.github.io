<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning On Your Ridgefield CT Home</h3>
<p>Each repair we carry out is important to us. Our AC technicians are professionally trained, and they continue to pursue continuous education. You'll find them knowledgeable about your particular AC system. The issue will be diagnosed correctly and the repair performed efficiently.

<p>Installation involves digging deep holes or long trenches to install the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll conserve cash over the long term because of the lower energy costs. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as conventional air-source units. The lack of moving parts means you're less most likely to invest huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're significantly more efficient then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>

<p>AC units and thermostats have integrated delay functions when they're closed down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts revealed and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance products that just a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, however a property owner does not have the tools or skills essential to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and proper air flow are important to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the required devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
