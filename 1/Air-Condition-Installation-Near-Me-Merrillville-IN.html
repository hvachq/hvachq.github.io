<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
