<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a reference in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
