Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. In addition, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

These elements include bad ventilation (absence of outdoors air), issues managing temperature, low or high humidity, current improvement, and other activities in or near a building that can impact the fresh air coming into the building. Often, specific impurities like dust from building and construction or restoration, mold, cleaning supplies, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (including small amounts of chemicals released as a gas with time) might cause bad IAQ.<p>
