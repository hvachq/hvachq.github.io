<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply eight to ten years old, it might suck up to twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would utilize.

Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER.

<p>I usually do not leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
