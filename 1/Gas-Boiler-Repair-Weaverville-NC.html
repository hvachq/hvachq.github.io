<p>A packaged system, usually set up on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, however it is also a choice for house owners to consider. Often times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system individually, since the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are generally only readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be a good way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best choice for property owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
