<p>The most hazardous asbestos fibers are too small to be visible. After they are breathed in, they can collect and remain in the lungs. Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (permanent lung scarring that can be fatal). Symptoms of these illness do not show up till several years after exposure began. The majority of people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some developed disease from direct exposure to clothes and devices brought home from task sites.<p>

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend utilized in autos in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by lots of people.<p>

<p>Buildings are created or intended to react actively to a few of these modifications in and around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sanitize, and keep surfaces to improve their appearance, durability, or efficiency. In other cases, such changes subtly and even dramatically change buildings in ways that might be very important to their own stability or their effect on building residents through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time. We might find it beneficial to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, particularly, a few of the techniques utilized by scientists studying ecosystems, in order to gain a boosted understanding of the environments in which we invest most of our time, our buildings.<p>
