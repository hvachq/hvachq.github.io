<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you ought to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
