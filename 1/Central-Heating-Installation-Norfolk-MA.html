<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must look out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
