There are a number of design techniques in usage today; however, all ground source heatpump operate with similar principles. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface area units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>
<p>A split air conditioning unit consists of 2 main parts - a compressor located outside and an inside air outlet unit. Unlike a system that needs a series of ductwork networked throughout the ceiling, split air conditioning system count on a set of pipelines to connect the outdoor to the inside air system which is why there are described as a ductless mini-split a/c unit installation Refrigerant is distributed through the copper pipelines that cycle through the system to produce either cold or heated air.<p>
