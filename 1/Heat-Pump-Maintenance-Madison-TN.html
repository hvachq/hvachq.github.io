<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the proper temperature. Furnaces that kick on regularly might be because of an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal issue.
