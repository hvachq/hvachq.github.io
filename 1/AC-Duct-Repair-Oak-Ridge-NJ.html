<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your automobile. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear.

During high usage months, check the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
