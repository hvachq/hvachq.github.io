<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor system as near your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat.
