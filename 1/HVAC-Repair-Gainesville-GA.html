<p>First, in regards to advantages, heating the whole house or building from one unit makes things simpler logistically, and the isolation of the heating system from the living space is a benefit for some house owners. The system can be used to supply warm water in addition to environment control.

<p>To be honest, few of the centers managers who use our indoor air quality tracking service came to us because of that.

<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Gainesville GA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
