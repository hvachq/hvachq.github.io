<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
