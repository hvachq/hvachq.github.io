<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>

The circuit boards manage and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the new control panel must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
