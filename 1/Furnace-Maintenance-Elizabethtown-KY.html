<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, considering that it is protected inside. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
