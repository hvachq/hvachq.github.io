Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price terrific however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
