<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat.

The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather significant.<p>
