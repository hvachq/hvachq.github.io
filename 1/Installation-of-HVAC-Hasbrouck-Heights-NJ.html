<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was really helpful in collecting details on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to briefly cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
