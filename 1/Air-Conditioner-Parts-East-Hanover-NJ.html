<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should temporarily change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost.
