Every one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can also worsen indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system might be polluted (since of mold in duct lining or bacteria on coil or filters, for example), and the system might spread these pollutants throughout the house.

<p>Unpredictable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals released as gases from procedures or products; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
