<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing at Plymouth Meeting PA</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively simple to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants given off by people, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are uncommonly high inside may trigger occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of co2 in the majority of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature level, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait at least five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
