<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do not accept them up until they have actually been appropriately dried. If products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
