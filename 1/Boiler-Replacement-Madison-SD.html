<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
