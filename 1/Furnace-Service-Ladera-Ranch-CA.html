<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on.

Prior to that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
