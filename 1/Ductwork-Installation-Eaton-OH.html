<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Eaton OH</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
