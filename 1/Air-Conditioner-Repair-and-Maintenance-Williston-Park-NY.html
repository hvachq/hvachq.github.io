<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by individuals and animals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
