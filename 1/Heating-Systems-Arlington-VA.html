This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
