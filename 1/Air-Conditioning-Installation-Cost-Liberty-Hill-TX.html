<h3>AC Maintenance Near Me in Liberty Hill Texas</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was sort of strange being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The item was very lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we resolved concerns. I would recommend this item to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time.
