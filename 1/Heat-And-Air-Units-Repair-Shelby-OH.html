<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
