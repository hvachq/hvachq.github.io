<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can manage, so many Seattleites must discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC units are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in flooring screens.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you must check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
