<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are utilized to seeing this enter the backyards of houses. With split system units, the majority of the elements are housed in a metal box outside of the house. However, there are some internal elements too. Split systems are perfect for cooling several spaces at the same time, but are not extremely energy effective. Therefore, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house. At the same time, the con would be that those who use this may spend more cash on cooling costs in the long run because of the lower energy effectiveness.<p>
<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
