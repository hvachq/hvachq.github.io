This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>There's a big difference between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common type of home heating-- convection. Over the past century, most of homes in chillier environments were warmed by convection, instead of radiation. Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the walls, floors and ceilings warmed. In turn, the objects in the space, like furniture and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>
