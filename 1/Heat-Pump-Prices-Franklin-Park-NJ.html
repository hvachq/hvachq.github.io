<p>Central air units are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they detected the issue and fixed really rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are used to seeing this key in the yards of homes. With split system units, most of the parts are housed in a metal box outside of the home. However, there are some internal elements as well. Split systems are ideal for cooling multiple rooms simultaneously, however are not really energy effective. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the home. At the same time, the con would be that those who use this may spend more money on cooling expenses in the long run since of the lower energy effectiveness.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit, think about potential impacts of indoor air pollution. Follow the manufacturer's directions, especially guidelines on the proper fuel and keeping the heating system correctly changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is normally an indicator of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heating system remains in use, open a door from the space where the heating system lies to the rest of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
