<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.
