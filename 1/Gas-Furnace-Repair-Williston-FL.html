<p>A specific ac system that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard a/c unit because both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the exact same air course. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, because all components of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat is removed.
