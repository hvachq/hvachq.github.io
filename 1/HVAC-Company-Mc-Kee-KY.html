<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ might observe musty or unpleasant odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
