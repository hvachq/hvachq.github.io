<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally connected to terminal systems like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
