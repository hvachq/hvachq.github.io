<h3>Fixing Your Boiler in Lititz PA</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based just on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few sensible ones got. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up team was considerate of my home and installed the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up inspection results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 unit it changed (also Carrier).<p>

<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my businesses, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is sincere, trusted, and affordable on price. It's tough to discover a sincere AC person and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years back and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
