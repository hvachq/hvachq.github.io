<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with routine preventive maintenance, however, there will always be the odd issue that occasionally shows up. It is really crucial that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible when you do notice your furnace behaving strangely. The faster you respond to issues with your furnace, the much easier they are to fix. Waiting to call for repairs will just make the issue even worse, and typically more expensive.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
