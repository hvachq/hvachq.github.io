<p>For whole home setups, it's challenging, if almost impossible, to retrofit a radiant heat system in an existing home, especially a hydronic system. Localized glowing flooring heat systems to be used in one or numerous spaces like restrooms, kitchen areas or laundry rooms are quickly renovated with electric radiant flooring heat. This is far more affordable on a smaller sized scale. Bigger remodellings like additions to a home may be suitable for a bigger scale and more costly hydronic system.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was essential and renovated the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater due to the fact that the service technicians believed they just didn't appear right and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
