<p>We suggest using our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by functioning as a really effective thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of permitting heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
