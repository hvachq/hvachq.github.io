<p>It may feel comfortable being sealed in tight versus the cold in your home throughout the chillier months of the year, but for people who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have respiratory issues, winter can exacerbate problems. Stale indoor air and heating systems can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing allergen, animal dander, and mold spores distributing through your house. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too cold to throw open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you await the warmer weather condition it is very important to be knowledgeable about a few of the allergy and respiratory triggers that might be prowling in your surroundings.<p>
