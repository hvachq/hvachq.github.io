"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
