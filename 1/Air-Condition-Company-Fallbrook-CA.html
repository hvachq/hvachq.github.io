<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not use automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
