<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can end up being clogged with debris that can limit air flow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's performance. Dirty filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases cause the system to close down totally. By comparison, checking and changing a furnace filter can normally be performed in just a couple of minutes, often with no tools needed. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>You might upgrade to the greatest performance equipment available and still not feel easily cool on hot days. That's due to the fact that the mechanicals are only part of the central air system. The average home's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Prior to deciding whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower systems, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring just how much air escapes the system.<p>
