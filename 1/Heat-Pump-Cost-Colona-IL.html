ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or below 65%.

According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure." Those processes include bringing in outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
