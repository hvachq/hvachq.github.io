<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
