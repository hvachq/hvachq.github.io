<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner in Knoxville IA</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely valuable. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
