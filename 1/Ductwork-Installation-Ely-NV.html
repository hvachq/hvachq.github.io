Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, given that the overall capability of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces may not have an extremely comfy temperature level.
