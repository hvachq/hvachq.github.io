<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a referral later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
