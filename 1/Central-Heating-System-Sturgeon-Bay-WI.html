<h3>Central Heating Systems in Sturgeon Bay WI 54235</h3>
<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most economical. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
