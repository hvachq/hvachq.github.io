<h3>The Way to Keep Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in Cayce SC</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present trend in home building is to minimize air leak through fractures and other openings in roofings, floorings, and walls. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
