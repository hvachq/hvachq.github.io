Breathing air contaminants can lead to asthmatic and allergic responses, infections and other illness that include the lungs, nose and throat.

<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location.
