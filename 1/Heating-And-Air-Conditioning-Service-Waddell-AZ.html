<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, as opposed to outdoor or commercial settings.

<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level.

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are likewise referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While room air conditioning offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is normally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
