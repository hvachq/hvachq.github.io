<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Grosse Pointe MI</h3>
<p>Another technique to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside your home. The majority of house heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors remove pollutants straight from the room where the fan is located and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Examine these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
