<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Maple Grove MN Home</h3>
<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by using clever technology.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
