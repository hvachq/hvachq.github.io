<p>The icing problem becomes much more extreme with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are frequently installed in tandem with a more standard kind of heating, such as an electrical heater, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
