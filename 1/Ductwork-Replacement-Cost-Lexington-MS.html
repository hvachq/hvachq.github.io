<h3>Electric Heating System in Lexington Mississippi</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Dripping return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<h3>Direct Purchase HVAC Equipment in Lexington MS</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
