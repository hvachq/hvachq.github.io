<p>The remainder of the HVAC system also needs to be in top condition for the a/c to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which reside inside the home.

Sealing leakages in ductwork can improve HVAC performance by as much as 30 percent, and offer a cooler home in the hot summertime.<p>
