<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
