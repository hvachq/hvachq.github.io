<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise houses bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has actually enjoyed the single-family home installation business entirely flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter season utilized to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not simply with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle house owners are finally giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
