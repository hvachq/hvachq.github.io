<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
