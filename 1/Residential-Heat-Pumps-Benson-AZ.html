This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things initially. Make certain all the registers in the house are wide open.
