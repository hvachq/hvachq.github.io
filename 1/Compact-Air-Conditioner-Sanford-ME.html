<h3>Ways to Get the Most out of Your HVAC System in Sanford ME</h3>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
