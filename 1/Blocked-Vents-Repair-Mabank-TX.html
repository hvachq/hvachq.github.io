<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use automobile debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
