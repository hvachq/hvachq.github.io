The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their total power needs to not exceed the capability of the outside system. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capability by at least 20%.

Simply put, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces may not have a really comfortable temperature level.

And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies monthly could be used to help you spend for a brand-new, much more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace.
