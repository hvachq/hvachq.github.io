<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their total power needs to not exceed the capability of the outside system. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect much better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, because the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces may not have a really comfortable temperature level.

And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies monthly could be used to help you spend for a brand-new, much more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace.
