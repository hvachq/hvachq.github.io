<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace service technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well.
