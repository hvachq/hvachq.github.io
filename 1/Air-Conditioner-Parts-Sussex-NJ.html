Secondly, there need to not be any obstacles en route of the air flow that might avoid it from covering the area of the facilities as much as possible. The outside system must likewise be located in an open area, otherwise the heat from your home will not be effectively discharged outdoors and the productivity of the entire system will drop sharply.
