<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
