<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance products that just a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner doesn't have the tools or abilities necessary to examine refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are important to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the essential devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still needed to have a professional technician examine the system regularly.<p>
