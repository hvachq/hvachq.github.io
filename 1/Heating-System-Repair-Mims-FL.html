<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
