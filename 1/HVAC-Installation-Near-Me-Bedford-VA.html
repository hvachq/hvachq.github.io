In-floor heating systems are not prone to this issue since they heat surfaces and not the air itself. Additionally, since they do not rely upon fans, ducts, signs up and returns to distribute hot air, in-floor heating systems can minimize the quantity of dust and seasonal irritants in your house.<p>
