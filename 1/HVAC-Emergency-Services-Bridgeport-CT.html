<h3>Direct Purchase HVAC Equipment at Bridgeport CT</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was needed and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater since the technicians thought they just didn't appear best and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
