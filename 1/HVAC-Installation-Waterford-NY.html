<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building and Commissioning is developed for architects, style engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other professionals worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include structure products, cigarette smoking, household items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas ranges or kerosene area heating units.
