<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run since it has to run longer than a properly sized system. Since it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The result is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
