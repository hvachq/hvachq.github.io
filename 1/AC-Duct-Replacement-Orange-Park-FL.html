<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace specialists often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>
