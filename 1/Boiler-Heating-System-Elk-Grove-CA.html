<p>Stability Energy fasted to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heaters were not working. They appeared the next day and changed 2 heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the new heating systems can heat the house. Truthfully, our home heater is complicated, Rob and his team repaired the old duct, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work completely.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
