<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but the house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
