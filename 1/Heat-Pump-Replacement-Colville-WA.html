<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
