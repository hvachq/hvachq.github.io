<p>Sean was really helpful. He is a very pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only factor he could not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
