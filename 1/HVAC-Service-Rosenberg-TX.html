<h3>Install Air Conditioner in Rosenberg Texas</h3>
<p>If your air conditioner is more than 8 years old, repair is most likely not worth the cost, unless it's an easy issue like debris blocking the condenser system or a worn fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to assess not simply the condition of your existing equipment, however likewise the ducts that deliver the cool air and the total quality of the insulation in your home.

<p>The answer to the concern, What does an HVAC technician do?, will vary somewhat depending on market of specialty, position, and employment.

<p>Re-install the access panel and disconnect block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and await the AC to begin (see Be Client at Start-up," below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan must spin. If the compressor starts however the fan does not, the fan motor is more than likely shot. Shut down the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. If  it does not, you have actually given it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
