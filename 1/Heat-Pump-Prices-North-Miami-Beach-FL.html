<p>Firstly, The after hours responding to service agent, John, was very polite and professional. Secondly, Gracion W is a prompt, well-informed technician. He was at my house within the time he provided me, repaired the issue while describing the issue then stayed several minutes to ensure it was working appropriately. The issue was repaired in a matter of time that I've never ever seen before while being a homeowner for ten years. I also recommend among the Security Strategies, which I am a member of, if you like to conserve money. Thank you." Karen P.<p>

<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in North Miami Beach FL</h3>
<p>Call Miller's A/c & Heating at (925) 447-3000 and always talk with a live and useful  member of our group, who will immediately concentrate on your requirements.

<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was required and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater since the professionals believed they just didn't appear ideal and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>

<h3>Residential HVAC in North Miami Beach FL 33160</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he encouraged me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the concern. He is truthful, reliable, and reasonable on rate. It's tough to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at threat. EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and severity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and may trigger thousands of nonasth-matic children to establish the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to secondhand smoke causes nose, eye, and throat irritation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually connected direct exposure to pre-owned smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
