<h3>Gas Heating in Sun City AZ 85351</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Equipment costs are driven by the kind of furnace at the heart of your house heating unit. Low-efficiency designs will cost less, but lead to higher energy bills. High-efficiency models cost more, however save more over the long run. Costs for gas heaters vary from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models approximately $12,500 for high-efficiency models. Electric heaters start at $395 and vary as much as $1,700 or more depending on the brand name and furnace size.<p>
<p>When your house's furnace stops working, your home can have more problems than just being uncomfortable.

When you call One Hour Heating & A/c, we'll find the right furnace solutions you need to keep you and your family comfy and your house safe.<p>

This makes they HVAC system work harder, producing a cycle that does not end. An overworked system will also cause your energy bills to rise. It's possible that the size of AC unit you have is not big enough for your house. It will have to work more difficult and might overheat if the system is too little.
