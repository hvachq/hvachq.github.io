<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Suitable Duct Sealing in Middle Island NY</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. Since it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off prior to it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The result is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
