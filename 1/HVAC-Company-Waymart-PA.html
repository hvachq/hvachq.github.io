<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
