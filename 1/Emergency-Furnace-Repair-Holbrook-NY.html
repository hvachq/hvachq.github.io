<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in loads. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes.

Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do not accept them until they have actually been appropriately dried. Try a various dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
