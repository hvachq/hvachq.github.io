<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace professionals frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the exact same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're dealing with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring devices will send the sensor information to the cloud, where you can access it through software. You get immediate, real-time access to the tracking results by means of a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are easy to understand.<p>
