<p>The predominant health impact connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
