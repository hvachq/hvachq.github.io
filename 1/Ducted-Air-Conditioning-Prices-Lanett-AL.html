Not only was the rate fantastic however Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
