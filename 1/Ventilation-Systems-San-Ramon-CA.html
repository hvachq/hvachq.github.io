<p>In a split-system central air conditioning conditioner, an outdoor metal cabinet consists of the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet includes the evaporator. In many split-system a/c unit, this indoor cabinet likewise includes a furnace or the indoor part of a heatpump. The a/c's evaporator coil is installed in the cabinet or primary supply duct of this furnace or heat pump. If your home already has a furnace but no air conditioner, a split-system is the most economical central air conditioning conditioner to set up.<p>

<p>New air conditioners usually range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER ranking indicates higher energy efficiency and potentially lower energy expenses. A good SEER score for you depends upon your home size, where you live and other factors. Even the minimally allowed SEER ranking is going to be far more energy effective than your existing, old air conditioning system. It's not always about choosing the design with the greatest SEER rating, it's discovering the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can help.<p>
<p>There are some more severe dangers for HVAC employees that could be possibly deadly. They can be exposed to Carbon monoxide gas which can be harmful. As HVAC service technicians frequently enter into contact with electrical wiring, they risk being electrocuted. They can also suffer other types of abrasions and burns to the skin. Although there are dangers connected with the task, it is normally carried out securely as long as correct care is taken.<p>
<p>The most harmful asbestos fibers are too small to be visible. After they are inhaled, they can remain and accumulate in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be deadly). Signs of these diseases do not show up till several years after direct exposure began. Most people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some developed illness from direct exposure to clothing and devices brought house from task sites.<p>

<p>Biological impurities: the biological pollutants can consist of bacteria, infections, fungis (mold), allergen allergen, animal dander, insect bio detritus, fibers and fiberglass, pollen, cockroach allergen, etc. and might result from insufficient maintenance and housekeeping, water spills, insufficient humidity control, condensation, or might be brought into the building by occupants, seepage, or ventilation air.

<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it comes to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to appropriately cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and people; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
