<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also might contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced on a regular basis may become blocked, minimizing air flow quality, volume, and circulation. They also might become locations for molds and germs to be and grow dispersed throughout the house. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems likewise must be appropriately preserved to avoid bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
