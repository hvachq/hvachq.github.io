<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor appliances through codes, and after more powerful guidelines are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 must be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements used for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be essential.<p>
