<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, however to have 2 major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee.
