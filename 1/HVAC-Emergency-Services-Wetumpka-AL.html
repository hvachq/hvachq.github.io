<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
