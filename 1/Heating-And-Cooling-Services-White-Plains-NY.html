<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area.

Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
