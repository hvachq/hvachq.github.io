<h3>AC Service in Mapleton Utah</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>The fuel lines that supply gas to your furnace should also be inspected regularly. Leaking gas and fuel can be a fire danger.

We had actually purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to check the ac system before you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to evaluate AC systems even in winter. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
