Initially, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
