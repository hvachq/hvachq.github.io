Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire.

One of the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen.
