<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
