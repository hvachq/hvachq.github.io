<p>The federal government recommends that houses be weatherized in order to minimize the amount of energy required for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, actions should also be taken to decrease contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for advised actions.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
