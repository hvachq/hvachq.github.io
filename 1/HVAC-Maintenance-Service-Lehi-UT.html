<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor carefully, a number of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed property owners.
