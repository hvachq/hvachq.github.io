<p>While pollutant levels from private sources may not pose a substantial health risk on their own, most homes have more than one source that adds to indoor air contamination. There can be a major threat from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Thankfully, there are steps that many people can take both to minimize the threat from existing sources and to prevent brand-new issues from taking place. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Security Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to act that can minimize the level of indoor air pollution in your own home.<p>
<p>The probability of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon numerous elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 essential impacts. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends on private sensitivity, which differs greatly from individual to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological contaminants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical contaminants also.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are often more difficult to manage than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
