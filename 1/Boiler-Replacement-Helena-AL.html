<p>While contaminant levels from individual sources may not position a substantial health threat on their own, most houses have more than one source that adds to indoor air pollution. There can be a severe risk from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Luckily, there are actions that many people can take both to reduce the danger from existing sources and to prevent brand-new issues from taking place. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to take actions that can reduce the level of indoor air contamination in your own house.<p>
<p>We recommend utilizing our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. When used in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of permitting heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Irritants found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become airborne, and hence, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of cat irritant might cause an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
