<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.. Second of all like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to properly service and the system has been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
