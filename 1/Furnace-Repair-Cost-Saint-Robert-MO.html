The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year.
