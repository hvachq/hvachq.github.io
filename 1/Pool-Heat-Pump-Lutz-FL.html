The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
