<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested educating me about our system, and left having solved the issue with an easy repair he did on-site, not replacing the entire part. He got along, simple and a completely enjoyable person to have around that entire time. His time and proficiency to FIX the issue cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a rather unpredictable diagnostic.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
