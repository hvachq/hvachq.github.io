<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Contractors in Walla Walla</h2>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit, think about prospective effects of indoor air contamination. Follow the maker's directions, particularly directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating system properly adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is normally an indicator of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heating system remains in use, open a door from the space where the heater lies to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
