<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems at Salem AL</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing trend in home construction is to reduce air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofs, floorings, and walls. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air helps and waters down indoor pollutants tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Check these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
