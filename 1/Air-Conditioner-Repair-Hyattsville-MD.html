<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a recommendation later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
