<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
