<h3>Ventilation System in Fairdale KY 40118</h3>

(See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.)

<p>In 2011, NASA was on the lookout for an a/c system to set up in their lunar electric rover. They decided they required expert aid and spoke with many providers. Finally, after an extensive choice process, the area agency selected Dometic. We've had a lot of firsts for many years, but this custom job presented special challenges for our engineers," said a representative for Dometic.

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For example, human beings breathe out carbon dioxide, which in little amounts is not hazardous, but might end up being dangerous if high concentrations are allowed to accumulate. Micro-organisms or bacteria may also exist within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they might spread throughout the entire workplace or structure by means of the ventilation system.<p>
