<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
