The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recognized inadequate ventilation as the primary issue in more than half the workplace indoor air investigations it has actually carried out. Examinations performed in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the same to be true. These investigations revealed that correct ventilation is important in keeping good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals used in the construction or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops should be utilized with fans that send exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating home appliances need to be sealed and power-vented systems installed to remove items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also create particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
