The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Ac system makers normally make rugged, high quality products. Start by checking any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner fails.
