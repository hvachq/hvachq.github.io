<h3>AC Maintenance in Cambridge MA 02139</h3>
<p>Do you need to change or repair part of your home's HVAC system? With those warm Washington summer seasons and chilly winter seasons, it is important for your house to be geared up with a high-performing cooling and heating system throughout the year. Whether you need an inspection, repair, installation or maintenance for your HVAC system, you can rely on the professionals at AAA Heating & Air Conditioning to get the job done right.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Speed System due to the fact that of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, a lot of Midtown Houston Tx clients do not know why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's most likely your problem. If you found that your conditioning filter needs replacing, then the next step is to thaw your a/c equipment. The simplest way to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
