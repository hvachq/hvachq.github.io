<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
