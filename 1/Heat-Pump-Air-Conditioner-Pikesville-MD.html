<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the potential to negatively impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, germs, and really small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should examine and, if required, update the building envelope. For example, he may seal spaces and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more effective service to your cooling problems than replacing your devices.<p>
