Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the standard water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut down completely.<p>
