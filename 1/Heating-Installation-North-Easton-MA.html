<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
