<h3>Central Heating Installation Agency in Folkston GA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide should be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might also be necessary.<p>
