<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services in San Jose CA</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really delighted that somebody as experienced as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c before you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to check AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
