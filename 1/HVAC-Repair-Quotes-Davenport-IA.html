<p>Excellent Product! Delivery was sort of unusual being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we solved problems. I would suggest this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>

<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Davenport IA</h3>
<p>I have been using Waychoff for about ten years. Initially, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Thereafter, they have actually kept my system semi-annually. Their techs are extremely experienced and professional. Costs are affordable. Always on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff installed a brand-new air handler and condenser today. Due to the fact that the cost was obviously sensible, I did not bother to get competitor's quotes since of my trust in Waychoff.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things initially. Make certain all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
