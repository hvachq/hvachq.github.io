<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of heating systems have several control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heaters, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control board must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t appropriately identified, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as set up. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a professional to diagnose.<p>
