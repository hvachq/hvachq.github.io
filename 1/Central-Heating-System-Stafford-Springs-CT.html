<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
