<p>The purpose of a lot of building ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for resident convenience while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and developing security at affordable energy costs. Load computing is referred to as the Handbook J estimation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to offering an installation or unit cost for air conditioning. If your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning unit you require based upon experience or on square video alone, transfer to another contractor.
