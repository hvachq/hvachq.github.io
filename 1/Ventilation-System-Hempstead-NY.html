<p>One of the disadvantages of central heating is that it's possibly costly to set up, specifically in an older house. Depending on the kind of system installed, it can be noisy and cause problems if you're extremely allergic to dust. Additionally, certain fuels and equipment might require special licenses, and there is limited versatility in the event of changed heating requirements. During use, there is a time delay while heat is being transported from the heating unit to the living space.<p>
<p>Geographically, some areas pay regularly higher incomes for air conditioning tradespersons. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable environment, or merely a high level of competitors for skilled trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's greatest typical salaries for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year. Massachusetts and Connecticut completed the 5 highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 per year.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge pollutants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without can be found in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
