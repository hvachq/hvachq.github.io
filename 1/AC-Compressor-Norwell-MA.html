<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run since it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. Because it simply takes more electricity to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to run. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
