<p>In addition, worker health symptoms such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing might be caused as the outcome of temperature extremes, inappropriate humidity levels, and too much or too little air circulation.

<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. When the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly harden and treat-- normally two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
