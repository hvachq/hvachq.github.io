During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, a lot of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product.

<p>Oil heating systems tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be properly vented and cleaned up from the furnace regularly. Modification the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned because the soot develops inside the ducts, decreasing their performance gradually.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
