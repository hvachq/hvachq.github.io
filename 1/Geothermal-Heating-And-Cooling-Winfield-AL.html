<p>In most cases, if materials have stopped working to dry a number of days after the presumed water event, mold development is suspected within wall cavities even if it is not right away visible.

<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company utilized 98% of the existing product purchased with the house. This company introduced a service arrangement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and plumbing. Throughout the evaluation on an extremely cold day they killed the furnace claiming health hazard factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a new resident I have learned how to recognize the truthful HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
