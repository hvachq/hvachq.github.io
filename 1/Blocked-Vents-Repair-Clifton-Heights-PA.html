<p>The life expectancy of a central air unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy effective than designs made even 5 years back, so it makes financial sense to change or update your system if it's 5 years old or older. The best central air conditioning conditioner you can purchase today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while delivering the exact same quantity of cooling.<p>
<h3>Heat Pump Repair in Clifton Heights Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil furnaces are gas heating systems While oil is generally utilized in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have a choice in between the two types. Gas heaters cost about the very same, roughly $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The genuine advantage of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, instead of the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
