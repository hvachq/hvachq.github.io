Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and people; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
