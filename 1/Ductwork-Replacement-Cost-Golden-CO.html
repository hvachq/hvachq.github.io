Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. Try a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
