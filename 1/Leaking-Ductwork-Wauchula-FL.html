<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating units are still widely utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>For instance, problems occur when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to bring in appropriate quantities of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation also takes place if the air supply and return vents within each space are blocked or positioned in such a way that outside air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building residents. Improperly situated outside air consumption vents can also bring in air contaminated with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological contaminants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ac system, or the inside surfaces of ventilation duct.<p>
