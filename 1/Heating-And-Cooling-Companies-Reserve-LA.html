<p>All houses need efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from usage. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the right temperature. Furnaces that kick on often might be because of a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>

In the process, heat is absorbed from inside your home and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
