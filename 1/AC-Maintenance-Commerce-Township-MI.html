<h3>Air Condition Repairing in Commerce Township Michigan</h3>
<p>Santa Clarita Custom Air uses complimentary in-home assessments for new furnace setups in the Santa Clarita and San Fernando Valley. Throughout an assessment, our owner and job manager will come out to talk with you about your heating issues and choices. Then, we will stroll through your home to assess the existing system, evaluate your ductwork, look for leaky windows, and take measurements of each room.

Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment set up just a few years earlier.<p>
