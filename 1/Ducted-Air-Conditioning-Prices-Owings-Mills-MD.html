<p>A geothermal heating system does not produce its power by burning fossil fuels such as oil, coal, or gas. Instead, it absorbs heat from within the earth.

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works but your house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
