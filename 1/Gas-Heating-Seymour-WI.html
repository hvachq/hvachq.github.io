<p>We contacted Elite HVACS on among the hottest days of summer( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out exact same day to evaluate situation & decided to opt for them for the work. I am happy to state that not just did we get the central air conditioning going but also replaced the heating unit which was old. Everybody we spoke to from starting to end were extremely professional, courteous and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators. This generally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Radiant heat supplies heat from the flooring up throughout the space with no cold areas or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>
