<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the check out. They advised replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was really pleased they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>
