<h3>The Way to Choose An HVAC Company in Washington GA</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based only on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of sensible ones received. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up group was respectful of my house and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post install assessment outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 unit it replaced (also Provider).<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
