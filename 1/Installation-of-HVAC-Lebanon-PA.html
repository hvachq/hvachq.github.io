<p>Recently, Target informed press reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the initial invasion into its systems was traced back to network qualifications that were stolen from a 3rd party supplier.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do decline them until they have been appropriately dried. If products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
