Overall, it has been an excellent experience. Dependable on the whole. Cool operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its appearances in the start. However then recognized Air conditioners are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>I extremely recommend using this service. Really reliable very good. Looked after a part that was not covered under service warranty fast and efficient and did not have to pay a leg and an arm to get it done. Fantastic company started by a guy who is aiming to grow his service and secure his household. He set up a complete system inside and out. Great system and an excellent cost.
