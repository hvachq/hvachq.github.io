<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ may discover unpleasant or moldy smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse.
