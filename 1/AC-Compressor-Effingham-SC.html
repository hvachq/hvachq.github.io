<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a recommendation later). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
