<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
