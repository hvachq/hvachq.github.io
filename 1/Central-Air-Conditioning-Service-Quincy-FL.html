<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and effectively, however to have two major elements fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>My eldest child constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think of anything else other than replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is itâ and low $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service contract tries to upsell you each time they come to perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was 6 months prior to the current one expired. She didn't need a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
