<p>IAQ can be impacted by gases (consisting of carbon monoxide gas, radon, unpredictable organic compounds ), particulates, microbial impurities (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stressor that can cause negative health conditions.

<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as created. Wetness management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the higher temperature levels often utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to supply thermal comfort inside. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the need for mindful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities generate mold development and moisture inside your home is related to a greater prevalence of resident respiratory issues.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a regular oil change in your vehicle. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and particles in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. Throughout high usage months, check the filters at least monthly.<p>
