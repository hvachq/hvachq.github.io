<p>We take a look at hints prior to we provide suggestions to change rather than repair a heater. One of the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are higher year after year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older system.<p>
<p>The primary reason homeowners do not buy an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the amount of services used.
