<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to look out for is the dust that gathers during summers. The very best thing to do is ensuring that the heating unit burners are inspected and cleaned completely before cooler seasons begin. Always make sure that the furnace is tidied up annually to prevent soot and condensation which causes burners to stop working correctly. Maybe it is time to begin thinking about purchasing a brand-new one if your furnace is in a really poor condition.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your house. Heat pumps work on electricity and work like air conditioning unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This permits them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heating system (like a space heating system) with the exact same amount of electricity. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
