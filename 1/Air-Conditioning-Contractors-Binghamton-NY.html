<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>Great Product! Delivery was kind of unusual being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was very lite weight and takes time to use. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we resolved issues. I would advise this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
