<p>The quality of the air inside our workplaces, homes and schools matters, especially considering that we spend the majority of our lives inside. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in exceptionally humid environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is oversized, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the ac system will need more energy to cool your house. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating components installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, sometimes connected to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
