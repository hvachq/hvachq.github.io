<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
