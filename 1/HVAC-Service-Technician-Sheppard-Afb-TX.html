<p>Excellent service within 24 hours and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very extensive in describing what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn supplied fantastic customer care at the end of the visit by explaining precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few tips of some maintenance jobs we may wish to have carried out in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale tactics utilized by some in the industry.<p>
