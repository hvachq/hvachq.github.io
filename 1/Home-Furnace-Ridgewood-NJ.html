<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
