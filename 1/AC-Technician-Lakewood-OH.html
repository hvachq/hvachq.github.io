<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my services, my own homes and my realty clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he advised me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the problem. He is sincere, trustworthy, and affordable on rate. It's tough to find an honest AC person and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
