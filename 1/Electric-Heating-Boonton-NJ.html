<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Boonton NJ 07005</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my companies, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again. He is truthful, trusted, and affordable on rate. It's tough to find a sincere AC man and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
