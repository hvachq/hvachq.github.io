Heatpump operate on electrical power and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like a space heating system) with the exact same quantity of electrical power. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
