<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<h3>Electric Heating System in Whitewater WI 53190</h3>
<p>We called Elite A/C on one of the hottest days of summertime( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out very same day to examine scenario & decided to choose them for the work. I more than happy to say that not just did we get the central air conditioning going but also changed the heating unit which was old. Everybody we spoke with from beginning to end were very expert, polite and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Indoor air contamination originates from a range of sources; the United States Epa (EPA) has determined structure materials, furnishings, and mold as severe concerns, however much of the danger also originates from burning things. For example, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can create pollution in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly huge problem in the developing world.<p>
<p>We advise yearly preventative Maintenance for your heating and cooling systems. Maintenance services will not only guarantee that your system is running as effectively as possible, but will also guarantee security. From replacing your systems filters and lines, to inspecting the voltages for electronic components, we run a thorough maintenance check. Offer us a call today to schedule your maintenance service.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by people and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
