<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
