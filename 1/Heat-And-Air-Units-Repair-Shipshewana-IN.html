<p>All Points Heating provides house a/c, ac system installation, air conditioning unit maintenance that provide reliable, proven performance at high effectiveness. Combustion products from vehicle exhaust, heating systems, hot water heater, area heaters, aromatic candle lights, oil lights, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas ranges that are not appropriately vented can produce carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion items might lead to nose, eye, and throat inflammation; fatigue; dizziness; and queasiness.<p>
<p>There are lots of things to think about when attempting to determine how typically I ought to change my air conditioning filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a distinct DNA on how it accumulates dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how frequently your cooling filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a better right decision on how often your HVAC filters require replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less typically you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 homes with only one a/c filter need changing more often.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
