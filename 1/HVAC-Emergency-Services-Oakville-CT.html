<p>When mounting a wall sensor, consider the height at which they should be positioned. Most frequently they are installed at height-level or slightly lower, if individuals primarily remain seated in that particular location. However, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate toward the floor or ceiling; depending upon what contaminant you're trying to track you'll need to position the sensor accordingly. For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside buildings are typically near the ceiling.
