<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>

<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems.
