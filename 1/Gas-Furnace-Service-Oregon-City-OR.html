I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again, he assisted me problem shoot the concern.

<p>Typically the most reliable way to improve indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of pollution or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to decrease the amount of emissions.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to supply adequate changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
