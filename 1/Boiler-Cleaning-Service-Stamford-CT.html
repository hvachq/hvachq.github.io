<p>When installing a wall sensor, consider the height at which they ought to be positioned.

<h3>Heat Pump Repair in Stamford CT 06902</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an abnormally high costs that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of issue. Ron had found the problem area in examining the costs. He fixed the issue in one day, had changed the costs to what I considered fair prior to he called back, knew what may have triggered the problem and had a plan to guarantee that it would not occur again. I have thought about All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have used them. This experience validates that.<p>
