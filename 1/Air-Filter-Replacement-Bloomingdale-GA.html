<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as close to your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Even with the best system and correct installation, there's always the chance that your furnace will malfunction. While some problems are caused by normal wear and tear, the majority of can be traced to irregular maintenance. Furnace concerns can wreak havoc in your home, specifically throughout the cooler months when you truly need to heat your interior. It's helpful to understand how to repair common issues so you can choose what to take care of yourself and what to let a professional handle.<p>
<p>Re-install the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Start-up," below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan ought to spin. If the compressor starts however the fan doesn't, the fan motor is most likely shot. Turn off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan begins. , if it does not, you have actually provided it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Own Furnace in Bloomingdale GA</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few affordable ones got. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install team was respectful of my house and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post install evaluation results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 unit it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
