<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy.
