<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Jamaica Plain MA</h3>
<p>Most people are aware that outside air contamination can affect their health, however indoor air contamination can likewise have significant, damaging result. EPA research studies of human exposure to air pollutants show that indoor levels of contaminants may be 2 to 5 times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- greater than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board regularly rank indoor air contamination amongst the leading five ecological health dangers to the general public.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
