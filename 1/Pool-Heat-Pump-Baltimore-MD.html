The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system.

<p>I am really satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service several years earlier and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
