<p>There are many sources of indoor air pollution in any home. These include combustion sources such as oil, gas, kerosene, wood, tobacco, and coal products; building materials and furnishings as varied as deteriorated, asbestos-containing insulation, wet or damp carpet, and cabinetry or furniture made of particular pressed wood products; products for family cleaning and maintenance, individual care, or hobbies; central heating and cooling systems and humidification gadgets; and outdoor sources such as radon, pesticides, and outdoor air contamination.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
