Closing off vents and registers in unused rooms is NOT a great idea. You will not conserve any additional money and will wind up causing more issues for your heater.<p>
<p>Before you go out and purchase an air conditioning system, there are a few things to choose initially. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioning unit? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioner be? Too large and you'll face problems with short-cycling, which can damage the ac system and reduce its life. Too little and your air conditioning system will not be able to cool your house properly. These are simply a few of the aspects that you need to take into account when buying a brand-new AC system. Each choice can and will considerably impact your system's performance, which is why you can't manage to neglect any of them.<p>
