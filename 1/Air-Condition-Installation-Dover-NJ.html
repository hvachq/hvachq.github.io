<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for years. But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel bills unexpectedly seem higher than regular, it is most likely time to think about a brand-new system. New heating equipment is far more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel costs immediately, not to mention the money you'll minimize repair expenses. If your heater is 25 years old or more, you can probably expect to cut your fuel bills in half.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
