<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
