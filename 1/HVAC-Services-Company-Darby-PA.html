<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions.

<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, ceiling, flooring, and wall coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days might become a source for mold development and need to be disposed of. In some cases there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can thrive in concealed or rarely accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials including carpet underpadding. Opportunities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the wetness issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the location using established health department suggestions.<p>
