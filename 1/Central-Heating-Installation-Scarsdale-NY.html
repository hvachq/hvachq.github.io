<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more difficulties, because some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each room.
