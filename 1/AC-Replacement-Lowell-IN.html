<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

New technical guidelines eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
