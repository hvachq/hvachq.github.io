<h3>Air Conditioner Repairs Near me in Bristol Virginia</h3>

<h3>Is Your Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Bristol VA?</h3>
<p>After living in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the cooling. I went ahead and purchased this Provider and I must state it does the job quite well. It takes really little time to warm up or cool down your house which is one of the things we didnâ $ t obtain from the one we had before. The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
