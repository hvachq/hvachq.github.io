<h3>How To Choose An HVAC Company in Lawrence NY</h3>
<p>Spot Ventilation. Outside exhaust fans must be installed in all kitchens and bathrooms. These fans remove humidity and carbon monoxide gas. The most reliable fans are resilient and peaceful. Usage fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans equipped with timers or de-humidistat controls are useful to make sure the fans run for an adequate time period. A good guideline is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
