<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the visit. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were heading out.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heaters were not working, integrity Energy was fast to respond. They appeared the next day and changed 2 furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the brand-new heaters can heat your house. Honestly, our home heater is complicated, Rob and his group fixed the old duct, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
