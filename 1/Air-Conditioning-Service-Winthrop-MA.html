<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. However, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>A specialized air conditioning system that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, however varies from a standard air conditioner because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the exact same air course. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space.

<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly lowers direct exposure to toxins during cooking. Incorrect modification, typically indicated by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue. Think about buying one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot light that burns continually if you purchase a brand-new gas range or variety. Never utilize a gas stove to heat your house. Constantly ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in usage.<p>
