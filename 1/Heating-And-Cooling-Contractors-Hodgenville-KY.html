When they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and tied them into a hot water supply, radiant heat systems have been around given that the days of the Romans. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and a primary pumping device to flow warm water that warmed their stone floorings.

<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges prohibited. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the technique as "that German innovation". 29 31 Nonetheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to create a corporate coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take actions to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-404a, R-134a and R-410a are, as of 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and air conditioning, R-1234yf in cars, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.

<p>The primary health effect related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year.
