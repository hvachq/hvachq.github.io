<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
