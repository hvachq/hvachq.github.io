This is usually used in a second or third-floor  area and takes advantage of the floor joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have built-in delay functions. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes.

If you have actually installed the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
