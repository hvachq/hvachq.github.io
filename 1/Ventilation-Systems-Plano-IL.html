<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not remove the mold.

The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
