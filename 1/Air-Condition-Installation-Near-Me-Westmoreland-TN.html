<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Design, Building And Construction and Commissioning is developed for designers, style engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other experts interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include building materials, smoking cigarettes, family products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heaters.

R-600 (isobutane) is already widely used in residential refrigeration.<p>
