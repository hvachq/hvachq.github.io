<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of exchanging or changing air in any space to supply high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and extreme wetness, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior structure air flowing, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your financial investment by just utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a licensed representative from a company or retailer to do the installation. If you select to attempt to do it yourself, or hire a non-licensed person to do the work, in many, if not all cases, you will void the warranty for the cooling system. A voided guarantee will not do you any great must the system stop working or malfunction. Do it right from the get-go and work with a certified individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
