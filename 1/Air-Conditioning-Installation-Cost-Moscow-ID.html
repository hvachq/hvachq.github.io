<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.. Secondly like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found someone to appropriately service and the system has actually been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
