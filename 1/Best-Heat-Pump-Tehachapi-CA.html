While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same).

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution.
