However, select your contractor carefully, many of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same).

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to supply sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical element essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
