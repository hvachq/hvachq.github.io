<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Image 6).<p>

<p>Lots of people undervalue the degree of the indoor air contamination problem. Air pollution is typically imagined as the black smoke produced from factories. Little idea is provided to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, pesticides, cleaners, and paints used in the house.

<p>Similar to many home enhancement projects, the cost of a complete central heater can vary commonly based on the size of the home. A lot of furnaces will last in between 15 and 20 years. In picking a furnace, property owners need to consider heat output and performance. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace need to be matched to the size of the house. A little house, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too rapidly and shut off for too long, resulting in irregular temperature levels.<p>
