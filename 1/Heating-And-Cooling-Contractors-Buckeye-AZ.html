<p>If you are considering setting up a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your home, plan on spending a number of thousand dollars for the complete system. The size of the system determines the labor hours involved to develop the system.

<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit contaminants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
