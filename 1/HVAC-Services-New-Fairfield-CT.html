<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>AC Service in New Fairfield CT 06812</h3>
<p>In general, ductless AC units are more eco-friendly and energy-efficient than standard HVACs. Since you can turn off private spaces when you're not inhabiting them, this is. On top of that, ductless A/cs can raise and reduce their temperature level easily, conserving you energy and money that regular HVAC compressors will waste by continuously starting up and turning themselves off.<p>
<p>We look at clues before we offer recommendations to change instead of repair a heater. Among the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can vary from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your pets to hazardous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a common air toxin resulting from gas that gets away into your house without being burnt. Older houses may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchens and restrooms, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where wetness levels are usually higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
