<p>Another technique to reducing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside. A lot of home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors get rid of pollutants directly from the space where the fan lies and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven.
