<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>AC systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up features when they're closed down and then repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends on the size of the unit and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, consisting of installation. Whole-house units, on the other hand, range in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heat pumps generally need excavation to install, which adds a number of thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you should look out for. First, you should inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
