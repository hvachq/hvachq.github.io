<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present trend in house building is to reduce air leakage through cracks and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofings.

<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by people and animals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
