<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Contractor in Opelika</h2>

<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for many years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel expenses all of a sudden appear higher than typical, it is most likely time to think about a new system. New heating equipment is even more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel expenses right away, not to mention the money you'll save money on repair expenses. If your heating system is 25 years of ages or more, you can probably expect to cut your fuel costs in half.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor system as near to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Air Condition Repair in Opelika AL 36801</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire.
