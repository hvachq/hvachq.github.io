The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure.

<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based on the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor home appliances through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit pollutants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to supply sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A common element essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
