<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.. Secondly like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad.

As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to properly service and the system has been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
