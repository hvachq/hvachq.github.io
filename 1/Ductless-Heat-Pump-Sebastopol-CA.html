<h3>Hints to Help You Hire Sebastopol CA Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging long trenches or deep holes to set up the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll conserve cash over the long term because of the lower energy costs. Likewise, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as standard air-source units. The lack of moving parts indicates you're less most likely to spend big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're significantly more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
