From one of the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some fundamental maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping airborne pollutants flowing through your system.

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts decades, since it is secured indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
