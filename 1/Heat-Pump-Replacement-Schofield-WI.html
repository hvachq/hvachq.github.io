<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off pollutants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical material gradually. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
