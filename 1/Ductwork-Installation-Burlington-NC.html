<p>4 Seasons has installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work.

<p>Aside from space heating, the geothermal heating unit can likewise be connected to a device referred to as a geothermal desuperheater.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
