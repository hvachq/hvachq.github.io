<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit increase. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
