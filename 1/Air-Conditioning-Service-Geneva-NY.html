<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.  Second of all like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found someone to effectively service and the system has been operating issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
