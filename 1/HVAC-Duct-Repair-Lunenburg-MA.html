<p>There are two main kinds of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's known in the house heating business. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the floor surface area. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are required to resist current, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
