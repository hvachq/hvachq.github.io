<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a recommendation later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
