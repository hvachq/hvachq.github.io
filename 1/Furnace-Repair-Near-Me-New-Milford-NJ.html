<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, since a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>

Momentarily increasing ventilation coupled with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be useful in watering down the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
