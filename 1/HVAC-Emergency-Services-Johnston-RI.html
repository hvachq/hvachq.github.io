<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical material in time.

Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
