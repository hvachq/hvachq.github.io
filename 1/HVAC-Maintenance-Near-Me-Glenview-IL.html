(If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
