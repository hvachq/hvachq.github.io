<p>All houses require efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the appropriate temperature level. Furnaces that kick on regularly may be because of a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>

<p>Lots of people ignore the extent of the indoor air contamination problem. Air contamination is typically imagined as the black smoke released from factories.

<p>Numerous initiatives imagine to decrease indoor air contamination by restricting VOC emissions from products. There are guidelines in France and in Germany, and various voluntary ecolabels and score systems consisting of low VOC emissions requirements such as EMICODE, 19 M1, 20 Blue Angel 21 and Indoor Air Convenience 22 in Europe, in addition to California Requirement CDPH Section 01350 23 and a number of others in the USA.
