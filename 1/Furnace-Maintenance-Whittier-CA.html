<p>Before you go out and purchase an ac system, there are a couple of things to decide first. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioner? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How big should the a/c unit be? Too large and you'll encounter problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning unit and shorten its life. Too little and your air conditioning unit won't be able to cool your home properly. These are just a few of the aspects that you need to consider when purchasing a brand-new AC system. Each choice can and will considerably affect your system's efficiency, which is why you can't afford to overlook any of them.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
