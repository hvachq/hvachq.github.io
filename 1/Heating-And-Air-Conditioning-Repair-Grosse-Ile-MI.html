The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor impurities and assists exhaust them from the house.<p>

As a first step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2.
