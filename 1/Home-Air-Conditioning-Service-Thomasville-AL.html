Most home heating and cooling systems, including required air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate.

Incorrect adjustment, frequently indicated by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame suggestion is blue. Consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continually if you acquire a new gas range or range. Never ever utilize a gas stove to heat your home. Constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in usage.<p>
