An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run since it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger system. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
