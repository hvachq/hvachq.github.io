<h3>Benefits of Purchasing on Gas Furnaces in Valencia CA</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present trend in house construction is to decrease air leak through fractures and other openings in walls, roofs, and floors. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor impurities and assists tire them from the home.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
