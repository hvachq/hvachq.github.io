<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>My eldest child always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I understood that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think of anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is low and itâ $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
