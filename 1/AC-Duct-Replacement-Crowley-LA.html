<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
