<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
