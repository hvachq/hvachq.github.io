<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like prolonged automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad.
