<h3>Is The Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Dearborn MI?</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of exchanging or changing air in any space to offer high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne bacteria, co2, and other gases. Ventilation removes undesirable smells and extreme wetness, presents outdoors air, keeps interior building air circulating, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
