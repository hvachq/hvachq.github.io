<p>I am very amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business several years back and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
