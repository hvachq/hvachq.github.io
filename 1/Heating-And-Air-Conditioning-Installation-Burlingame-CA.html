<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make certain all the registers in the house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
