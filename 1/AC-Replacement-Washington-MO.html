<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise houses bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has watched the single-family home installation service entirely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with beginners more accustomed to AC living.

<p>If you set it too low, you're motivating the growth of mold in damp air. The heat dries the air, preventing mold growth and pollution. Naturally, too-dry air can also irritate your sinuses and lungs, while too much indoor humidity can contribute to the growth of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that may affect the health of people who live in the house. Contaminants might come from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground below. An air toxin could also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or personal care products. Viruses and germs, animal dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
