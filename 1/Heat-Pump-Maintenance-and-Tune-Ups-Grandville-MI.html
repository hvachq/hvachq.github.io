<h3>Leaking Ductwork in Grandville MI 49418</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet.

However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
