<p>The most common type of house heating system in the U.S. burns natural gas or lp to produce heat. With a typical cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least costly alternative, but more recent systems can be very energy effective. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems normally accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, extremely efficient natural gas heating systems can achieve AFUE ratings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roofing system, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, but it is likewise an alternative for homeowners to think about. Many times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, considering that the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are generally just readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best alternative for homeowners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
