<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Rapid City SD?</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in house construction is to minimize air leakage through cracks and other openings in floorings, roofings, and walls. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Ventilation, air, and heating conditioning (HVAC) systems need routine maintenance and care. These are the systems that keep your house comfortable all year long. Regular maintenance plays a key role in guaranteeing that your heating & cooling system remains running efficiently which you get the most out of your financial investment.
