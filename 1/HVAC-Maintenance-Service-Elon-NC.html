<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that may affect the health of people who live in the house. Contaminants could originate from outside the house-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon entering your house from the ground listed below. An air contaminant might also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, unpredictable organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or personal care products. Germs and viruses, animal dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce toxins.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>This review is for replacing a 17 years of age AC with a new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat. The technician who discussed our alternatives did an excellent task in ensuring we understood the benefits and drawbacks of each option. The technicians who installed the brand-new system were professional and quick, while taking time to make sure we comprehended how the new system worked. In general a very first rate experience.<p>
