It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not simply with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle house owners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
