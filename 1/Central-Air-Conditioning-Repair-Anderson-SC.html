<h3>Truth All Homeowners Must Know About HVAC Installation in Anderson SC</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or changing air in any area to provide high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and extreme moisture, presents outdoors air, keeps interior structure air distributing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
