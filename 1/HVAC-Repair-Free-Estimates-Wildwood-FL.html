<h3>Duct Cleaning On Your Wildwood FL Home</h3>
<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise houses bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has seen the single-family house installation organisation completely flip on its head the last few years. Winter season used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not simply with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle house owners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
