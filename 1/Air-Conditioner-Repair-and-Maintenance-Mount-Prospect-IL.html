All the wet hot air that goes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then eliminated from the area that is being cooled. If your HVAC unit is not draining pipes properly, you'll have a water leakage. A restriction in your drain pipes causes a water leak. There are various places an obstruction can happen. One of the main locations where obstructions begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
