<p>Ventilation plays an important role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those processes consist of bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. If one or more of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
