<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them until they have been effectively dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
