<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more problems, given that a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each room.
