<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also might contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed on a regular basis may end up being clogged, lowering air circulation volume, circulation, and quality.

Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also should be properly preserved to prevent germs and mold contamination.<p>
<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to carry the heat to the rooms. A lot of modern hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the distribution system (as opposed to older gravity-fed systems ).

The radiators may be installed on walls or set up within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
