<p>Among the disadvantages of central heating is that it's potentially costly to install, specifically in an older home. Depending upon the type of system set up, it can be loud and trigger problems if you're extremely allergic to dust. In addition, specific fuels and devices may need special permits, and there is minimal flexibility in case of changed heating requirements. During use, there is a dead time while heat is being carried from the heating system to the living space.<p>
<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently higher wages for air conditioning tradesmen. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable climate, or simply a high level of competitors for skilled trades.
