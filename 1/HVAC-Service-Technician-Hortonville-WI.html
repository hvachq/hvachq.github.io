And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts revealed and re-installed the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>We take a look at hints before we provide suggestions to replace instead of repair a heating system. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy.
