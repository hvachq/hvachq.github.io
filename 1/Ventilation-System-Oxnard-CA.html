<p>I am really impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may choose to replace the outside compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency system. If you do so, consult a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the new compressor is properly matched to the indoor system. However, considering recent modifications in refrigerants and a/c designs, it may be wiser to replace the whole system.<p>
