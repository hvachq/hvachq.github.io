<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packing product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, location 2 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
