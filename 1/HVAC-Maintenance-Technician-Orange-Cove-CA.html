<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has an integrated performance advantage since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions due to the fact that they do not require any new ductwork to be set up. Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
