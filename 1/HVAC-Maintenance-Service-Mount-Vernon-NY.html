<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the unit has actually been running issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
