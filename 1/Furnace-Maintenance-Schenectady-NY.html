Proper ventilation and elimination of the sources of these contaminants are important in maintaining excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>If your central air conditioning conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running, it may just need to be cleaned up. Whether or not this is the reason for the issue, it's a great early solution to try. Strategy to do this on a reasonably warm day. Never ever use a power washer for this-- it can damage the fins.
