<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do not accept them till they have been appropriately dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can pay for, so many Seattleites must find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in huge box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC units are taken up as soon as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a cruel, cruel summertime.<p>
