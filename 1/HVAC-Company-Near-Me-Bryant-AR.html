<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
