<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may go into close-by ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical facilities and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor water fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
