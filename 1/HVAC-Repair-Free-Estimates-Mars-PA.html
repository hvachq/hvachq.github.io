<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to save energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the higher temperatures often utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to supply thermal comfort inside. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities generate mold growth and wetness indoors is related to a higher frequency of occupant breathing issues.<p>

<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else might come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they needed to order it. My wife stated that she had actually seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent people I have actually satisfied in a very long time. If we wish to have options to ACME heating, we need to support the genuine people who are there for us. Please do.<p>
