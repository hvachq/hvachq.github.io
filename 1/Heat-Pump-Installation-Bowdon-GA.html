<p>There are many things to consider when attempting to figure out how often I should change my cooling filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has a distinct DNA on how it collects dust and dirt. It takes about six months of close observation to see how often your a/c filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better right decision on how often your HVAC filters require changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 houses have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less frequently you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 homes with just one a/c filter require replacing regularly.<p>
