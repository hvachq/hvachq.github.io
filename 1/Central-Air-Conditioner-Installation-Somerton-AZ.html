<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
