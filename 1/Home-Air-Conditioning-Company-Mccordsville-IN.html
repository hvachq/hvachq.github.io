Everyone I have actually dealt with is friendly and expert. The techs are prompt, polite and effective. They strive to complete every task as rapidly as possible and comprehend our financial needs on all 5 of the commercial residential or commercial properties on which I help with the management.<p>
<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
