<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must look out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
