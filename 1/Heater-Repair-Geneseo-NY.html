<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you must inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
