<h3>Heating System Repair in Thornton CO 80241</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>If you're searching for an honest, hard-working, very dependable, & knowledgeable a/c & heating contractor - give Around the Clock a call! I was initially referred to Ilan & his group by several of my neighbors when I relocated 5+ years back. I have them perform a yearly tune-up & the numerous times I require a service call, Ilan was able always able to fit me in the very same day. They're great with the communications - phone, text, e-mail! I position allot of worth on a small company owner who lives in the community he services.<p>
