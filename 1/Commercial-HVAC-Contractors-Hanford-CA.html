<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, a lot of Midtown Houston Tx clients do not know why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's probably your problem. The next step is to defrost your air conditioning devices if you discovered that your conditioning filter needs changing. The simplest method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
