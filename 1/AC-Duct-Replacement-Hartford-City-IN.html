<p>Over the past few years, there has been some promotion suggesting that houseplants have actually been shown to reduce levels of some chemicals in lab experiments. There is presently no evidence, however, that a reasonable variety of houseplants eliminate substantial quantities of contaminants in offices and houses. Since overly wet soil may promote the development of microorganisms which can affect allergic people, indoor houseplants should not be over-watered.<p>
