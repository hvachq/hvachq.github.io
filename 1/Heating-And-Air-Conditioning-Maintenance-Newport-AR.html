He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years earlier and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
