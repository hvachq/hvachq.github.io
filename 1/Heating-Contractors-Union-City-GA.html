Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
