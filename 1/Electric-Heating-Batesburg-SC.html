<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now.

He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
