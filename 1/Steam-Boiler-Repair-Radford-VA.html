<p>We contacted Elite HVACS on among the hottest days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to evaluate scenario & chose to go with them for the work. I more than happy to state that not just did we get the central air going but likewise replaced the heating unit which was old. Everyone we spoke to from starting to end were extremely professional, courteous and the work was extremely effectively done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>I am changing our High Velocity System since of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, the majority of Midtown Houston Tx consumers do not know why their HVAC unit is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's most likely your issue. If you discovered that your conditioning filter needs changing, then the next step is to defrost your a/c equipment. The simplest way to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
