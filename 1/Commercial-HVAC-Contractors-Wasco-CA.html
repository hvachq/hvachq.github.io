<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
