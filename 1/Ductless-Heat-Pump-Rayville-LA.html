<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in on a monthly basis, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
