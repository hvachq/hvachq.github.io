The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not use auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year.
