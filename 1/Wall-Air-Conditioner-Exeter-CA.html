In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops should be utilized with fans that send exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating devices ought to be sealed and power-vented systems installed to eliminate products of incomplete combustion.
