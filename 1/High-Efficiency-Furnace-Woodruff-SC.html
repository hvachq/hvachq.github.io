Buildings constantly progress as a result of the changes in the environment around them as well as the occupants, materials, and activities within them. The different surface areas and the air inside a structure are constantly interacting, and this interaction results in modifications in each. For instance, we may see a window as changing a little over time as it becomes dirty, then is cleaned, collects dirt again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life.

When checking your air conditioning devices to turn off all primary power from the emergency breaker panel or disconnect switch, always make sure.
