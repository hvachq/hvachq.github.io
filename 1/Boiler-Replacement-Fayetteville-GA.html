<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Contractors in Fayetteville</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioner unit that sits outside your home. Heat pumps run on electricity and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This allows them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heating system (like an area heating unit) with the same amount of electrical power. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
