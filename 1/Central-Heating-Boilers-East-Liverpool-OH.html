<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.<p>

My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices.

I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
