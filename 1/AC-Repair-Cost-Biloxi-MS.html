Residential units can further enhance indoor air quality by regular cleaning of carpets and rug.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it could suck up to twice the electrical power that even a low-end new one would use.

Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices installed just a couple of years ago.<p>
