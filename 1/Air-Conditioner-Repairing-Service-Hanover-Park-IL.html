<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ may observe undesirable or moldy odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues.

However not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
