<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down totally.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
