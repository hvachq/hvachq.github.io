<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your house that perfect temperature throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task.

Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
