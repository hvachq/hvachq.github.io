<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your house that perfect temperature throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task.

So, be sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get a cooling service plan which generally includes a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants.

Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
