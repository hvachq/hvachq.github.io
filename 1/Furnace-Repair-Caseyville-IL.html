<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and certifications. An excellent location to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there haven't bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Building Efficiency Institute (BPI) accreditation. Managers with BPI accreditation know that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one aspect (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>
