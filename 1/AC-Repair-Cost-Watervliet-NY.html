<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space.

Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage.
