<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Once every year to make sure all the systems are working well, you need to get your HVAC system aesthetically inspected at least. This assessment is a crucial element of HVAC maintenance. If you do not get your system examined, you won't notice a problem till it quits working in the middle of winter season. That's the last thing you desire since you will need to hunt for alternative heating sources till the system is fixed. Routine evaluation and maintenance also helps keep it in great shape and prolongs its life.<p>
