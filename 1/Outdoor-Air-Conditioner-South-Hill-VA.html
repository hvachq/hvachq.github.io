<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, considering that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c individually for each room. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
