<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price terrific however Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
