<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make certain all the registers in the house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up.

<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
