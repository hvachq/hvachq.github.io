<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtration. From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some standard maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne pollutants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping reduce the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot beside the radiators. This generally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides warmth from the floor up throughout the space with no cold areas or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>
