Make sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we solved problems. I would suggest this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the very first time.
