<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in gathering details on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear interaction about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
<p>Stability Energy fasted to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heaters were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced 2 heating systems and make them work.

<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by individuals and animals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
