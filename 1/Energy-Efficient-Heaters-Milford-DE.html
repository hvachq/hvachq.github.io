Initially, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
