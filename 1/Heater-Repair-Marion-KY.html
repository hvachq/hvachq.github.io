<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, check out Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
