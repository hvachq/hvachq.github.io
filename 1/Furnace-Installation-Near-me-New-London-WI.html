"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
