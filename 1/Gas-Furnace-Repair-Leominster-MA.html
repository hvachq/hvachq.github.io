<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then determine the height and width of the opening.

Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by people and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.

Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
