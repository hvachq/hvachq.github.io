<p>Indoor air pollution originates from a variety of sources; the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified building products, furnishings, and mold as severe issues, but much of the threat likewise comes from burning things.

<p>Irritants are materials that cause an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold.
