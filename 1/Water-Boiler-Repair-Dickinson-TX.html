<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
