In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather.

The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

<p>Through normal use and the unit's presence outside, the coils and fins of the a/c may become really filthy. These aspects of the devices are essential for effective air conditioning.

<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can manage, so many Seattleites need to discover methods to combat the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service.
