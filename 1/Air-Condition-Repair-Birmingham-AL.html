<h3>Central Air Conditioning System in Birmingham AL 35242</h3>
<p>One of the disadvantages of central heating is that it's possibly expensive to install, especially in an older house. Depending upon the type of unit installed, it can be loud and cause issues if you're highly adverse dust. Furthermore, particular fuels and devices might require special authorizations, and there is limited versatility in the event of changed heating requirements. Throughout usage, there is a dead time while heat is being transferred from the heating unit to the home.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Yearly furnace maintenance is the best way to keep your heating unit working securely and efficiently. That's why we offer our special Comfort First Subscription that makes preventive care budget-friendly and simple. Ask us about our maintenance program that can save you 25 percent on service over the life of your system. Because when you take care of your furnace, it will look after you with lower energy costs, less repairs, and more years of comfort.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit, think about prospective results of indoor air pollution. Follow the producer's instructions, particularly guidelines on the correct fuel and keeping the heater properly adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is usually a sign of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heating system remains in usage, open a door from the space where the heater is located to the rest of the home and open a window a little.<p>
