<p>Simplify your services, make more services income, and offer an amazing consumer experience. To ensure the system you pick is the best size for your house, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load estimation estimate to identify the exact type of heat and cooling system that's just right for your home-we do not simply replace it with the same size system you currently have. These calculations take into account things such as the size of your house, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is essential so the unit isn't too large-both or too small waste energy.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as near the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
