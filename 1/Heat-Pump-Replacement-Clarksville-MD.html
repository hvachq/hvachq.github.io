<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature level of the flooring. All wiring for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>Before you go out and buy an a/c unit, there are a few things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioning unit? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to install some or go ductless? How large should the a/c be? Too big and you'll face problems with short-cycling, which can harm the a/c and shorten its life. Too small and your air conditioning unit will not be able to cool your house appropriately. When shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are just a few of the elements that you need to take into account. Each choice can and will substantially affect your system's efficiency, which is why you can't manage to disregard any of them.<p>
