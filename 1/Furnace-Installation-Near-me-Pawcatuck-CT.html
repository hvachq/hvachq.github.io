<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was kind of weird being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged.

We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we solved issues. I would recommend this item to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
