<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Springville NY</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in house construction is to minimize air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofs, floors, and walls. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
