<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace at Willowbrook IL</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field.

From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
