<p>I usually do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
