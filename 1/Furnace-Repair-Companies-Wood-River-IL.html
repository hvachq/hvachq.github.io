<p>The world's leading all-in-one software for residential and commercial HVAC companies. HVAC service technicians go through a number of possibly hazardous conditions. Specialists are frequently needed to work in cramped areas, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofs of houses. They can be exposed to unfavorable weather for long periods of time. Because they are called to structures without operating climate control, they are also based on the severe hot or cold temperature levels existing inside an area.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges unlawful. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the approach as "that German innovation". 29 31 However, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to create a corporate union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take steps to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-404a, R-134a and R-410a are, since 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and a/c, R-1234yf in cars and trucks, R-32 in residential a/c and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is already commonly utilized in residential refrigeration.<p>
