<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>These men have actually been great. At a real estate agent, I in some cases require contractors to offer me an opinion for what deal with a house may cost. Just recently I needed to call on these guys two times. They came out rapidly and offered me a no nonsense estimate for the work. Even when it was news my customer probably would not want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Integrity isn't just their name, it's a business design they take seriously. You people are officially on speed dial. Talk with you quickly.<p>
<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. As soon as the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively treat and solidify-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
<p>Advanced designs of new homes are starting to include mechanical systems that bring outside air into the home. A few of these designs consist of energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (also called air-to-air heat exchangers). For more information about air-to-air heat exchangers, get in touch with the Conservation and Renewable Resource Questions and Referral Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
