If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
