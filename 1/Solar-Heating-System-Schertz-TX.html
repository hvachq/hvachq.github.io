<h3>Furnace Installation in Schertz TX 78154</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>The installation was fast, professional and effectively done. The installers were polite and understood exactly what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and recognize easily people who are proficient at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are great and do not miss out on information that creates a job extremely well done. I really highly suggest the two gentlemen as they are exceptional at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and gratitude for a task well done.<p>
<p>My oldest kid always complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
