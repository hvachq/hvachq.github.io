<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you should examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
