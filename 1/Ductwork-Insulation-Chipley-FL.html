<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Chipley FL</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the math recently, however I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio where the system sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
