<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  system rather of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater since the service technicians believed they simply didn't seem right and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
