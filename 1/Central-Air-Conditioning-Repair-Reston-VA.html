<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace at Reston VA?</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
<p>The majority of modern air-conditioning systems feature a dehumidification cycle during which the compressor runs while the fan is slowed as much as possible citation needed to minimize the evaporator temperature and therefore condense more water. When the temperature falls listed below a limit, both the fan and compressor are shut down to mitigate more temperature level drops; explanation required this avoids wetness on the evaporator from being blown back into the space. citation required When the temperature rises again, clarification required the compressor reboots and the fan returns to low speed.<p>
