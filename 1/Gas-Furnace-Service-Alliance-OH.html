<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the higher temperatures often utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to provide thermal convenience indoors. However, high humidity outdoors develops the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities generate mold development and wetness indoors is associated with a greater prevalence of occupant breathing issues.<p>

Trane heat pump has actually worked effectively and is so efficient that it substantially reduced our energy expenses - the system will spend for itself in less than 5 years.
