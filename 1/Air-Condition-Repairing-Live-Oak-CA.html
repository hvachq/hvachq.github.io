<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have 2 significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
