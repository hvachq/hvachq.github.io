<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Sewell NJ</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Check these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
