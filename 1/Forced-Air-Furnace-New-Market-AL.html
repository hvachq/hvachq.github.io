<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to briefly manage the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
