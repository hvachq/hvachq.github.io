<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your home are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do decline them until they have been correctly dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
