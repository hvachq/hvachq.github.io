<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner at Salisbury NC</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating system. We selected getting something more costly than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>

As you saw recently, you need an appropriately-sized system for your home. Otherwise, the AC will break down sooner than expected or your regular monthly energy expenses will skyrocket. For that reason, you don't have overall control as to your AC unit product costs.<p>
