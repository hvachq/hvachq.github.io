Recent research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do not accept them until they have been properly dried. Try a various dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
