<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is often important to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such information can in some cases be gotten by asking for copies of air tracking data from the employer. If keeping an eye on information is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union agent should ask for that the employer have air tracking tests carried out. Review of this information might identify potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when impurity concentrations are really low, keeping an eye on information may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
