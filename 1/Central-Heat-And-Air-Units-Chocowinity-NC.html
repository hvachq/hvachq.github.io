Improperly located outside air consumption vents can also bring in air contaminated with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological contaminants that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ac system, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>
