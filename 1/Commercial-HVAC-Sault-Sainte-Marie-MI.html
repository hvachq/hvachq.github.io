<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
