<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price great but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced.
