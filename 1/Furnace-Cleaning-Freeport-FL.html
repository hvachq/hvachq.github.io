<p>A geothermal heater is more reliable than options, and is not affected by any external factors, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar energy depends on regular sunshine to work effectively. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the sun nor the wind, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a reliable and available source of energy.<p>
