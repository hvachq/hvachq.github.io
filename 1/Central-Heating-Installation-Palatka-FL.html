If, for instance, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you might establish your monitoring equipment to signal you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
