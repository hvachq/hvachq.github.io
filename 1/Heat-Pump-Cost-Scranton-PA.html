<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the see. They recommended replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
