<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
