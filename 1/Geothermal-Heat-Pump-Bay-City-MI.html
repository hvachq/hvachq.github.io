<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really practical in gathering info on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to temporarily deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and offered clear interaction about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began.

<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roof, is most typically used on commercial structures, however it is also an option for homeowners to consider. Often times, these systems include not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those aiming to save money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, because the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are usually just offered for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best alternative for property owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
