<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
