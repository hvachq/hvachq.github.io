<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps operate on electricity and work like a/c unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
