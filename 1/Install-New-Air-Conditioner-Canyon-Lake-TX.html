<p>In the last several years, a growing body of scientific evidence has actually suggested that the air within homes and other structures can be more seriously polluted than the outside air in even the biggest and most industrialized cities. Other research study indicates that people invest approximately 90 percent of their time indoors. Thus, for many individuals, the dangers to health may be greater due to exposure to air pollution indoors than outdoors.<p>
<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly reduces direct exposure to pollutants during cooking. Inappropriate modification, typically suggested by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you buy a new gas stove or range, consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot burner that burns continuously. Never utilize a gas stove to heat your house. When the fireplace is in usage, constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
