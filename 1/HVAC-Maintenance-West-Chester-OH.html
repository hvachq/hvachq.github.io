<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit easily into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand.

<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time fixing the issue, all the while describing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me.
