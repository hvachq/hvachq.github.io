<h3>Central Air Conditioner Installation in Concord New Hampshire</h3>
<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold.

The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
