<p>When installing over concrete pieces, we recommend using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash when used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely efficient thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of allowing heat to warm up the concrete piece listed below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your home that best temperature throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those typical air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their job.

So, be sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service plan which generally includes a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
