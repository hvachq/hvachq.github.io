<p>I typically do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
