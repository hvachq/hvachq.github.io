<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a referral later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4).

The female crimp ports should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
