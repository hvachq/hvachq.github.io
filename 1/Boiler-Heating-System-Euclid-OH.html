<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Many HVAC entrepreneur don't recognize they require various rates schemes for different services that their company provides. For example, residential HVAC installation ought to be priced in a different way from commercial HVAC installation, and an HVAC service should be priced differently from duct cleaning.

<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
