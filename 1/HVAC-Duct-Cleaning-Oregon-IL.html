<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be extreme. They include hold-ups in physical and psychological development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, children, and infants are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults since lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more conscious the harmful results of lead. Kids might have higher direct exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

<p>When our furnace was dying, we contacted two local companies for bids. While both were informative and practical, Ballard Natural Gas gave us a much better offer, for extraordinary service. Instead of a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heating system and located methods we might have more even heat.

<h3>Boiler Maintenance at Oregon IL - Reasons Why You Would Have to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor system instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor system. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling.

<p>Oil heaters tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be correctly vented and cleaned from the furnace frequently.

Anticipate to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
