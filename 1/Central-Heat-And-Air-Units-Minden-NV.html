<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold.

<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay.

<h3>Get Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Minden NV</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run since it simply takes more electrical energy to run a larger system. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed moisture. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
