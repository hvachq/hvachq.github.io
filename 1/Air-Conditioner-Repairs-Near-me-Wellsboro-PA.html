Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating adequate outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the house. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>Truth: Federal and local incentives normally amount to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial rate of a system competitive with traditional devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capability, during brand-new building and construction (homes typically use in between one and five tons). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. However, brand-new installation practices are lowering costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to standard systems under the right conditions.<p>
