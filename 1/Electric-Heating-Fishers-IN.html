<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC unit is wintry.

<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience periodic periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them again. Shut off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position.
