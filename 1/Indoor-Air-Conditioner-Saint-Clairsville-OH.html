<p>The purpose of many structure ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for resident comfort while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing safety at sensible energy costs. Load determining is referred to as the Handbook J computation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor before offering an installation or unit cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square footage alone. As with determining the size of an unit needed based upon BTUs, determining the right size of system for your house also depends upon the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out.

<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
