<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Indoor air pollution is brought on by burning solid fuel sources - such as fire wood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The job of an HVAC technician is relatively complicated and can vary considerably from one home or office to the next. Every maintenance task and repair is different from the last. Every maintenance job may need absolutely various steps and procedures than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being checked. Installations can also vary significantly, depending on the age of the structure and how well the existing system was installed. In some cases, totally brand-new ductwork might need to be installed in a structure that had none before.<p>
