<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. Because up to 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in effectiveness benefit. Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions because they do not require any new ductwork to be installed. Due to the fact that a system is installed in each room or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>
