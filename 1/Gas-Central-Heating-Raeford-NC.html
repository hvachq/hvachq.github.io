<p>It's not recommended for uncertified individuals to examine & repair cooling & HVAC equipment. There is a threat of electric shock & death if not correctly trained in emergency ac repair check-ups. If you left it to a skilled ac repair Houston Midtown tech for proper HVAC diagnosis, it would be best. Constantly make sure when examining your air conditioning devices to turn off all primary power from the emergency breaker panel or disconnect switch. Be extremely careful when examining capacitors, even with the cooling system off. Capacitors can hold a high voltage charge, even with the power switched off. An unexpected discharge from an a/c capacitor can trigger extreme injury or death.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue.

A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
