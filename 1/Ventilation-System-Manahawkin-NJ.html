If you're dealing with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking equipment will send out the sensor data to the cloud, where you can access it via software. You get immediate, real-time access to the tracking results through a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are simple to understand.<p>
