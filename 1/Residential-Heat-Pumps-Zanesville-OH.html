<p>Recent Review: They were excellent! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for. They fulfilled my needs completely by supplying a professional quote with choices, without pressing additional products. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also immediately followed up with the essential inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>The primary health impact connected with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
