<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
