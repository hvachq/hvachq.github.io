<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are prone to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot next to the radiators.

Radiant heat offers warmth from the flooring up throughout the space with no cold spots or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>
