<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a recommendation in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight.
