<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
