<p>Often, indoor air quality problems in big commercial structures can not be successfully recognized or fixed without an extensive building investigation. These investigations might start with composed surveys and telephone consultations in which structure investigators examine the history of resident symptoms and structure operation treatments. Sometimes, these inquiries may rapidly uncover the problem and on-site sees are unneeded.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from inside your home and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
