<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works but your house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<h3>Truth About Eatontown NJ Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit require reasonably little attention. But, just like any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is necessary to keep the system working efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system are similar to those of conventional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank ought to be looked for leakages, the system ought to be flushed regularly to get rid of tank and gathered impurities (scaling in hard water areas). The systems must be inspected a minimum of twice per year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to remove dust gathered in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
