<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on.

Even though you might think that clearing the space of all items that may catch fire sooner or later provides enough security, often other junk such as lint and dust may gather inside the furnace which may cause a fire.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do decline them till they have actually been effectively dried. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
