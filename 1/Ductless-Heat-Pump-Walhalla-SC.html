<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most inexpensive. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
