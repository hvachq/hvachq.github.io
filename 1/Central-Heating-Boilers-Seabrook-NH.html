<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Seabrook NH - Reasons Why You Would Have to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems require fairly little attention. However, just like any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is vital to keep the system functioning smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit resemble those of conventional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank need to be looked for leaks, the system should be flushed regularly to remove tank and collected impurities (scaling in difficult water areas). The systems need to be examined a minimum of twice per year for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed occasionally to get rid of dust collected in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
