<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the see. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the new part.

<p>A health survey should be established and distributed to all concerned workers. Such a tool should identify the number of people affected; define ages and task descriptions of involved workers; determine where they lie within the workplace; show when the symptoms take place (time of day, day of week, and season); provide a list of specific health signs or illnesses; identify all machines operated in the office; suggest the type of outdoors air contamination; and identify potential sources of job tension.<p>
<p>Through typical use and the unit's existence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioner might end up being extremely dirty. These aspects of the equipment are essential for efficient air conditioning. The technician cleans all elements, and checks connections to ensure they are secure. The system is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic parts are examineded for appropriate function and overall condition. This is an excellent chance to recognize parts that are used or malfunctioning. When the issue is relatively small, changing them to fix the air conditioning may be a lot less pricey.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more challenging to control than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
