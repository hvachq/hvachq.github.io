<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

At the same time, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roofing system, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, but it is also a choice for homeowners to consider. Many times, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those aiming to save money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, because the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are usually only available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best alternative for homeowners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
