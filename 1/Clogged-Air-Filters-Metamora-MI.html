<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 ought to be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
<p>Irritants are materials that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens discovered in indoor air are primarily biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being airborne, and thus, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of cat allergen could bring on an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, but not in those people who do not have cat allergies.<p>
<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by people and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
