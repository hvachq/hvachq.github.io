<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in performance advantage due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions since they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Since an unit is installed in each space or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance in Belton Texas</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>

<p>Because they eliminate moisture from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a normally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To deal with condensate problems, please see A/c Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
