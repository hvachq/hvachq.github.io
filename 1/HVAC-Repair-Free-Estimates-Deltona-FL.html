<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power needs to not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor system.

The higher the system's SEER rating, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all appliances.<p>
