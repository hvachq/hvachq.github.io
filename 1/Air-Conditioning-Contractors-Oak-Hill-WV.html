<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.. Second of all like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has been operating issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
