<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Lots of common structure products used prior to 1975 include asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Typically, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not occur unless the building products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation.

As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
