<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a different split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, because some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
