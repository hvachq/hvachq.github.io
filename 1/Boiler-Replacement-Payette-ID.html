<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard job that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps men working. When a sales male comes to your house he is there to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and must not "need" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I offer you the options for your requirements and you choose if you require it.<p>
