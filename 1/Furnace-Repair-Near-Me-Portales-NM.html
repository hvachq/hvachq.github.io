<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
