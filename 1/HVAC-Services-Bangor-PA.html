<p>Structures are designed or intended to respond actively to some of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sterilize, and preserve surface areas to enhance their appearance, performance, or durability. In other cases, such changes subtly and even considerably alter buildings in ways that may be very important to their own integrity or their effect on structure occupants through the advancement of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We may find it useful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, especially, a few of the approaches used by researchers studying environments, in order to get a boosted understanding of the environments in which we spend the majority of our time, our structures.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was really useful in gathering info on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to briefly manage the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
