<p>It may feel relaxing being sealed in tight against the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, but for people who are delicate to indoor allergens or have respiratory issues, winter can intensify issues. Stale indoor air and heater can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your home. In late winter season and early spring, it might still be too cold to throw open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you await the warmer weather condition it is very important to be knowledgeable about a few of the allergic reaction and respiratory triggers that may be hiding in your environments.<p>
