People likewise respond extremely in a different way to direct exposure to indoor air pollutants. Additional research is needed to much better understand which health impacts take place after exposure to the typical pollutant concentrations found in houses and which occurs from the greater concentrations that occur for short periods of time.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Re-install the access panel and detach block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch.
