<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO protect the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor carefully, many of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
