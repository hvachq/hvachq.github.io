Rather of sending out air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and therefore the quantity of moisture in the air could be managed, which in turn made the humidity in the room manageable. The controlled temperature and humidity helped keep constant paper measurements and ink alignment. Later on, Carrier's technology was used to increase efficiency in the office, and The Carrier A/c Company of America was formed to meet rising need. Over time, air conditioning came to be used to improve comfort in homes and autos too.<p>
