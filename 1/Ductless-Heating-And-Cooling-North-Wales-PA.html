<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite substantial.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
