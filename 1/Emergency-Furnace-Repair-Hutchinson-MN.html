<p>There are two main types of glowing floor heating, or RFH as it's understood in the house heating business. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are forced to withstand current, which then produces heat.<p>

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely.
