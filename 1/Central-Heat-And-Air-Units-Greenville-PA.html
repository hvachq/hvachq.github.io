However, it is incorrect to expect much better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, considering that the overall capability of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outside unit.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have.
