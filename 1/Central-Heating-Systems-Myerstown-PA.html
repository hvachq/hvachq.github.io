After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
