<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you must look out for. First, you should examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
