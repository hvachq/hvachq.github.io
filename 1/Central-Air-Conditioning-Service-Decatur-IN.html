<p>Similar to many home enhancement jobs, the cost of a full central heating system can differ commonly based on the size of the house. A lot of heating systems will last between 15 and 20 years. In picking a furnace, homeowner must think about heat output and efficiency. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace need to be matched to the size of the house.

<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an unusually high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of concern.
