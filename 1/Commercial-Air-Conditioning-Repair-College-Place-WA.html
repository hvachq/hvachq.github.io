<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is improperly removed from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in houses can also arise from lead dust from outside sources, including contaminated soil tracked within, and use of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outside) air to dilute polluted (indoor) air. Local building codes likely define the quantity (and sometimes quality) of outdoor air that need to be constantly supplied in your buildings, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Momentarily increasing ventilation coupled with appropriate usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be helpful in watering down the concentration of toxic fumes in the air.<p>
