<h3>The Way to Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Muskogee OK</h3>
<p>After residing in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the air conditioning. I went ahead and bought this Provider and I need to state it gets the job done rather well. It takes really little time to heat up or cool off the house which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t obtain from the one we had in the past. The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in vehicles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, however is still imported and can be bought and utilized by qualified HVAC specialists. For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by numerous individuals.<p>
