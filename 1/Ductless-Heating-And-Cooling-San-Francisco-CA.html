This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>I typically don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
