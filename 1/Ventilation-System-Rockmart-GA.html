<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Contractors in Rockmart</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it really rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
