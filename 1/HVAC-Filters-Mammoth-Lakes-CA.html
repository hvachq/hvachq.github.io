We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they required to remove the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit.

If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
