<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized.
