<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Necessary Service in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are ranked 90% performance or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient.

As a result your oil or gas furnace might run longer to provide the exact same amount of heat. This will trigger your energy costs to increase. And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies each month could be utilized to assist you pay for a brand-new, much more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating bills with heating costs from the previous years. If there is a considerable distinction, then it's time to replace your furnace.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
