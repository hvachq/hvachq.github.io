From one of the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some fundamental maintenance.

Such immediate results are typically short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is simply removing the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined.
