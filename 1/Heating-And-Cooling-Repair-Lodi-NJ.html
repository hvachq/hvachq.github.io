Not all heating systems are good for all houses, and there are a couple of aspects that absolutely need to be considered before choosing one. Initially, you'll require one that is effectively sized for your house.

Next, switch off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the air conditioning service still does not work effectively after you've cleaned the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs.
