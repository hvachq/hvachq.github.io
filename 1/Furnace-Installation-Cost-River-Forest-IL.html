<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
