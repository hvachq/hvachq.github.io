<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
