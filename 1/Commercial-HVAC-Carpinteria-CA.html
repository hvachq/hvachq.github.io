<p>A specific a/c that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic a/c unit in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the very same air course. A basic air conditioning system transfers heat energy out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, given that all elements of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat is removed. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is in fact heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power.<p>
