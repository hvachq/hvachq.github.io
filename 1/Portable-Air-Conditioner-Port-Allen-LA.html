<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
