<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside system as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

So, ensure to decide based upon how often you will use your heating unit, the load that will be put on it and the frequency with which you plan on having it serviced each year.

<p>A radiator is the part of your automobile that keeps the engine cool and safeguards it from extreme heating. To be cool, the radiator needs to remain tidy - always. With time, sludge, rust and other solid deposits build up inside your cars and truck's radiator. These make the cooling system become blocked and less reliable. This in effect injures your vehicle's efficiency. A regular radiator flush suffices to keep the system in shape. For this reason, make radiator flushing a part of your regular vehicle maintenance schedule. For all your radiator flush requirements, call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
