<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils.

It also prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
