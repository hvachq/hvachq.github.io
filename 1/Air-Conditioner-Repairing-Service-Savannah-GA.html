<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which may go into close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor water fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
