The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each room. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>

<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit easily into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand.

<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may wish to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capacities. You may look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and effectiveness if you already have a home heating system.
