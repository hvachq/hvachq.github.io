The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each room.

<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit easily into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand.
