Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have found them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work.

No extra charge.<p>
