<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home won't heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
