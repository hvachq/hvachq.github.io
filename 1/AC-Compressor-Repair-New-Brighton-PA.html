<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location.

Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home.
