<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
