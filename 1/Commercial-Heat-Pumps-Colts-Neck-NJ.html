<p>The function of most building ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for occupant comfort while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and developing security at affordable energy expenses. Your furnace has many parts that can impact the health and safety of you and your loved ones. Having a complete check of your furnace will offer assurance that it is safe to run.
