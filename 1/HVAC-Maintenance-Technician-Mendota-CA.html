<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside system as close to your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
