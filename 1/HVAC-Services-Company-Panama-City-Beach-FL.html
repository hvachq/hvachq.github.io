<p>Excellent service within 24 hr and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was really comprehensive and on-time in discussing what services would be performed.

<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment producer's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in place. In addition, the concrete results of a PM is frequently hard to quantify, as one response mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or ac system don't just break at the breeze of a finger, but rather is the result of recurring use of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early degeneration, resulting in cracks and holes. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.  a really useful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
