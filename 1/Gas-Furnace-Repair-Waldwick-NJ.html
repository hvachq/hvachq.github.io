<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to properly solidify and cure-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>The primary health effect related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
