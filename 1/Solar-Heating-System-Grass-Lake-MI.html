The choice of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power needs to not surpass the capability of the outside unit.

However, the computation of the overall power is not basic, considering that it considers not only the small power of the systems, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
