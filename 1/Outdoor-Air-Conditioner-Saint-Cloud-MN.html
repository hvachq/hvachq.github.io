<p>A regular furnace tune up can go a long method towards lessening a number of the concerns triggered by build-up of dirt and particles, and the examinations permit your contractor to keep track of longer-term problems and take proactive actions to help avoid premature failure or inconvenient breakdowns throughout the heating season. Yearly furnace service may also be a requirement to keep your furnace guarantee valid as well.

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Dometic's commercial grade rooftop air conditioners are performance-tested to overcome severe or unusual road and weather conditions. Lots of standard systems break down after simply 4 hours of severe vibration screening, while the Brisk II is still going strong at 30 hours and more! The galvanized steel top plate supplies long lasting strength while long copper lines minimize vibration and, therefore, noise too. While being one of the hardest air conditioning system around, its 410A refrigerant is kinder to the environment. Robust, light-weight and capable of carrying out in any environment! It will not let you down.<p>
