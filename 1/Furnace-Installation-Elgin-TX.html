<h3>Why You Need Air Conditioning Repair in Elgin TX?</h3>
<p>I have been using Waychoff for about ten years. Initially, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Afterwards, they have preserved my system semi-annually. Their techs are very experienced and expert. Expenses are affordable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff installed a new air handler and condenser today. I did not bother to get competitor's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff because the cost was undoubtedly reasonable.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
