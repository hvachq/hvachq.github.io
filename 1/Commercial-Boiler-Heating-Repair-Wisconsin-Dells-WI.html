<p>Spot Ventilation. Outside exhaust fans should be set up in all restrooms and kitchens. These fans remove humidity and carbon monoxide. The most reliable fans are quiet and long lasting. Use fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans equipped with timers or de-humidistat controls work to guarantee the fans run for an adequate period of time. A good rule of thumb is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix utilized in automobiles in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and utilized by qualified HVAC professionals. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by numerous individuals.<p>
