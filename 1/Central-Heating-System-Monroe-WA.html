<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors.
