<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all major devices producer's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in location. Additionally, the concrete outcomes of a PM is frequently hard to quantify, as one response mentioned the cost savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioner do not just break at the breeze of a finger, however instead is the result of recurring usage of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature deterioration, leading to holes and cracks. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the part.  a very helpful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>
