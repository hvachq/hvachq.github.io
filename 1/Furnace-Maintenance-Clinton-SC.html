<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, many of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
