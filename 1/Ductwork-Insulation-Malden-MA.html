<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
