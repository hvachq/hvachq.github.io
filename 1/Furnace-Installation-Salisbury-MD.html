Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are tidy, tidy them again. Switch off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the air conditioning service still does not work properly after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC will not work fully unless you do this.<p>
