<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) is a relatively easy to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants released by people, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are uncommonly high indoors might cause residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of co2 in most buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
