After 2 years, things began to change. There have actually been uncomfortable noises. I got it fixed and examined. I am hoping that is completion of the problem. Overall, it has been a good experience. Reputable on the whole. Neat operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its appearances in the beginning. However then realized ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend utilized in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12.

For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by lots of individuals.<p>
