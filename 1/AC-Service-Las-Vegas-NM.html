<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
