<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to use car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
