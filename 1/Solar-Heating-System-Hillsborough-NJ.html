<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same. As soon as the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly harden and cure-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
