<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as vital as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. Throughout high use months, check the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
