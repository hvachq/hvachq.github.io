<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity professional at a large merchant who asked not to be called since he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a team that routinely keeps an eye on energy usage and temperature levels in stores to save money on expenses (particularly at night) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the stores change beyond an acceptable variety that might avoid customers from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>Consider a whole house dehumidifier if your single phase air conditioner isn't old sufficient to validate replacement. By setting up dehumidification equipment inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy some of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without replacing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, improving indoor air quality and enabling higher convenience at greater temperature levels.<p>
<p>No matter what kind of heating unit you have in your home, you can conserve money and increase your comfort by effectively maintaining and updating your devices. However keep in mind, an energy-efficient furnace alone will not have as excellent an effect on your energy costs as using the whole-house method By combining proper equipment maintenance and upgrades with recommended insulation, air sealing, and thermostat settings, you can conserve about 30% on your energy bill while decreasing environmental emissions.<p>
