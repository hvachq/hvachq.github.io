In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced.

A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

When the air conditioning unit works however the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
