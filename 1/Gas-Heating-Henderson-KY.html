<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not get rid of the mold.

Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>In most cases, if products have stopped working to dry out a number of days after the believed water occasion, mold growth is thought within wall cavities even if it is not right away visible.

<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
