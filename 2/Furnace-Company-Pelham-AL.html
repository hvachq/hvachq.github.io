<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the conventional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>
<p>For example, problems arise when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in sufficient quantities of outdoor air. Inadequate ventilation also occurs if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or placed in such a way that outdoor air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building residents. Poorly situated outdoor air intake vents can also bring in air infected with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological impurities that have actually increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct.<p>
