<p>Measurement treatments are being established and demonstrated to evaluate building ventilation and indoor toxin concentrations. These treatments range from advanced tracer gas techniques used mainly in developing research efforts to less involved treatments that can be employed by developing operators. NIST researchers are continuously developing brand-new test treatments, and then demonstrating them in the field to assess their feasibility and reliability. The efforts in which these procedures are shown in the field has actually resulted in the advancement of a crucial database of structure ventilation and indoor air quality efficiency.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide should be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements used for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
