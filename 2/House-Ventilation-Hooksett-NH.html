<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely comprehensive in discussing what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn supplied great customer care at the end of the visit by explaining precisely what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have done in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale strategies employed by some in the market.<p>
<p>I am really pleased with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years earlier and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
