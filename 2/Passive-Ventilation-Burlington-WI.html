<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the job and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the system has actually been operating problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
