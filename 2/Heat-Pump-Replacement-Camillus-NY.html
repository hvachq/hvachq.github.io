<h3>Commercial HVAC in Camillus NY 13031</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
