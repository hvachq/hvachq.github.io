<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx clients do not understand why their HVAC unit is not working when they put a 24 hr emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil.
