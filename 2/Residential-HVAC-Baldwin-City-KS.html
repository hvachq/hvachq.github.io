<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Heating, air, and ventilation conditioning (HVAC) systems need regular maintenance and care. These are the systems that keep your home comfy all year long.
