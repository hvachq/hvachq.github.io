<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as vital as a routine oil change in your automobile. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter better traps impurities and debris in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. Throughout high use months, check the filters at least monthly.<p>

<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is typically higher than numerous heatpump choices, they can still be highly effective, depending upon the model you purchase.
