<p>As with most house improvement projects, the cost of a complete central heating system can vary widely based upon the size of the house. Most heaters will last in between 15 and twenty years. In selecting a furnace, property owners should think about heat output and performance. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the house. A little house, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too quickly and turn off for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
