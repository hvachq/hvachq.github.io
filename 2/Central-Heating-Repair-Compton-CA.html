Many common structure products used prior to 1975 include asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Usually, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation. Since the fibers can be spread out into the air during the removal procedure, elimination of asbestos-containing materials is not always optimal. A management program for intact asbestos-containing products is typically suggested instead.<p>
