<p>The likelihood of instant responses to indoor air pollutants depends upon several factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 important impacts. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a contaminant depends on individual sensitivity, which varies greatly from person to person. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system likewise might contribute to indoor air quality issues.

Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also must be correctly preserved to avoid bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
