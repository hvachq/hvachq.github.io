<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
