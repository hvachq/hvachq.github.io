<p>Lots of people underestimate the degree of the indoor air pollution issue. Air contamination is generally imagined as the black smoke released from factories. Little thought is given to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, cleaners, paints, and pesticides used in the home.

<p>Because they get rid of wetness from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, below.<p>
