<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps in Corbin KY</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit. We decided on getting something more costly than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our biggest utility expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
