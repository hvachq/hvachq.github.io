<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building and Commissioning is designed for designers, style engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other experts worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include building materials, smoking cigarettes, family products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene area heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a number of purposes in manufactured items. For instance, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothes and drapes, as an element of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finish items.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Picture 6).<p>
