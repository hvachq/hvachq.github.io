<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
