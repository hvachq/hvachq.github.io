<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
