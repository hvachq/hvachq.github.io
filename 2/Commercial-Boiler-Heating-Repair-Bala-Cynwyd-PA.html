<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this.

The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
