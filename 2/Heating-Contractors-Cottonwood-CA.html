<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more challenging to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
