<p>If the AC does not turn off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
