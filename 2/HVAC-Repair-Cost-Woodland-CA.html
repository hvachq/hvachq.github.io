<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat.

As soon as the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly harden and treat-- usually 2 to 4 weeks.

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
