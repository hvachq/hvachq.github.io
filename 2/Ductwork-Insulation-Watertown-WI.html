<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

If we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
