<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
