<p>Initially, unlike central air conditioning, you have a few options when it comes to central heating unit. We'll jump into expenses later, but you can choose from a boiler, furnace or heat  pump.

<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat distribution over the entire surface area of a floor heats the lower half of the room, covering occupants in warmth at a lower total temperature level-- sometimes as much as 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a traditional heating unit." In other words, in-floor heater provide a various mode and level of comfort. And, as numerous public awareness campaigns have long reminded us, the more comfy we feel, the more likely we may be to push down our thermostat, in turn lowering our energy expenses.<p>
