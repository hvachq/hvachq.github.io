<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>Some biological impurities trigger allergic reactions, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Infectious health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are sent through the air. Mildews and molds release disease-causing toxins.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical product with time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
