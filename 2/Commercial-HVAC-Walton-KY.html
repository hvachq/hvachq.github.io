<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you ought to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
