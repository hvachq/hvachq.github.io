<p>A main factor in the prevention of health signs is an effective, appropriately created and running ventilation system. The ventilation system identifies the quality of the indoor air by controlling the quantity of air that is added to the office atmosphere, the cleanliness of such outside air, and the rate at which the office air and its pollutants are either exhausted to the re-circulated or outside throughout the building.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
