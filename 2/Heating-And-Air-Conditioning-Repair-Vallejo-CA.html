<p>This is particularly significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Unstable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from products or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.
