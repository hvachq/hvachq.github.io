<h3>Central Heating Boilers in Union Missouri</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
