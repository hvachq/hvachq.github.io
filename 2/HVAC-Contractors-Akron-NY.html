<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product with time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
