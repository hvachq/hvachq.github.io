Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I feel like they offer me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that comfort.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven. Screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler usually happen when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips.
