<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts which unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>
