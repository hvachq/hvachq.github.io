<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise homes bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has watched the single-family home installation service totally turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter season used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not just with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle homeowners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
