<p>Ensure there are no carpets, furnishings, or anything else limiting the circulation of air.

<p>This is particularly significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>It is also suggested for locals of Redmond to have access to heating systems inside their houses. Throughout the winter seasons, heaters provide sufficient heating power to houses in the community.

<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
