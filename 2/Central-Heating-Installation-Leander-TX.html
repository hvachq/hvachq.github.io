<p>Sean was really helpful. He is a really pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no problems other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
