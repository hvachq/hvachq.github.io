<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
