The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
