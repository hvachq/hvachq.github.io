Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has watched the single-family house installation organisation completely flip on its head the last few years. Winter season used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle homeowners are lastly giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
