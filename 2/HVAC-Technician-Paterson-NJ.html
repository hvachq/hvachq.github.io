<p>Dometic's commercial grade roof a/c are performance-tested to get rid of extreme or unusual road and climate condition. Numerous basic units break down after simply four hours of extreme vibration screening, while the Vigorous II is still going strong at 30 hours and more! The galvanized steel top plate provides enduring strength while long copper lines lessen vibration and, for that reason, noise too. While being one of the toughest air conditioning system around, its 410A refrigerant is kinder to the environment. Robust, lightweight and capable of performing in any environment! It won't let you down.<p>
<p>When installing over concrete slabs, we advise using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when used in combination with underfloor heating by functioning as an extremely efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of allowing heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
