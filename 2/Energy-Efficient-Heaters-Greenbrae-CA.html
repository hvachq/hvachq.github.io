The choice of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power must not surpass the capability of the outdoor unit.

Put simply, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that a few of the rooms may not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not simple, given that it considers not just the nominal power of the units, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
