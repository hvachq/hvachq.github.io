<p>I am very amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years back and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>As discussed above, triggering your brand-new under tile floor heating system too soon, prior to the mortar has actually cured, can trigger the grout to crack or to not adhere appropriately, and may void the warranty of your mortar item. In some testing, even the tile broken when the system was run before the substance had actually cured. If you do not follow their directions, and mortar producers may decline warranty protection.<p>
