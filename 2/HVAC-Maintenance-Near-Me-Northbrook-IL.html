<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate since it just takes more electricity to run a bigger unit. And an oversize system does not lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
