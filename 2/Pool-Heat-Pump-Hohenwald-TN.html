<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
