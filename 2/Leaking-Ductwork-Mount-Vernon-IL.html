<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types.

Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heating.<p>

<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to start without the boost it needs from the capacitor.

<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are likewise referred to as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While room cooling supplies optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of spaces at a time it is usually more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
