<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the see. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was extremely pleased they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will certainly be using them again.<p>
