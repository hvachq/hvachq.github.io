<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and a/c (HVAC) systems are as various as the different houses they serve (single household houses, duplexes, mobile homes, apartment or condos, high-rise condominiums, row real estate, and so on).

<p>Check these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The minimized air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
