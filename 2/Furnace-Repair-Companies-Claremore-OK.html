<p>The possibility of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon a number of factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 crucial impacts. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a toxin depends on specific sensitivity, which differs significantly from individual to individual. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological toxins after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical pollutants also.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
