<h2>How To Hire HVAC Company in Pomona</h2>

<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller home, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other elements that can affect this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
