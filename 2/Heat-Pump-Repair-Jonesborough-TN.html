Ask your heating contractor for the most suitable choice.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make certain all the registers in the house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
