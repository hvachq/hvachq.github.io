Carbon monoxide is a common air pollutant resulting from natural gas that escapes into your house without being burned off. Older homes may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In restrooms and cooking areas, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where moisture levels are typically higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, wall, ceiling, and flooring coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days may end up being a source for mold development and should be discarded. Often there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can prosper in concealed or seldom accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, possibilities exist will be mold growing nearby. Repair the wetness problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the location using established health department recommendations.<p>
