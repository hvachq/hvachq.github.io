<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
