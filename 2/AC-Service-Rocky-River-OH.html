The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
