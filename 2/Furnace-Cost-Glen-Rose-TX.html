Current studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do decline them until they have been properly dried. Try a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
