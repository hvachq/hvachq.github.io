<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals utilized in the building or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops need to be used with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances ought to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to remove products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can likewise create particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
