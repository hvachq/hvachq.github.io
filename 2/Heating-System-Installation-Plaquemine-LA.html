<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room air conditioning offers optimum versatility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is normally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
