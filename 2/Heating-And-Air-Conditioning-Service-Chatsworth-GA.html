<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in Chatsworth GA</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely happy that someone as experienced as Adam was able to return and fix the air conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to test the a/c prior to you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had methods to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
