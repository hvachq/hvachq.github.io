<p>Truth: Federal and local incentives typically total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial cost of a system competitive with conventional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capability, during brand-new building and construction (homes generally use in between one and 5 loads). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. Nevertheless, new installation practices are minimizing costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to traditional systems under the right conditions.<p>

<p>Indoor contaminants. These consist of chemicals utilized in the building or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops must be utilized with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems installed to remove items of incomplete combustion.

<p>A third way to decide whether your home may have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, look for indications of issues with the ventilation in your house.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
