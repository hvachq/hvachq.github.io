<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Eudora KS?</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are extremely effective, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is constantly at a continuous temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only achieve a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates how much heat a system removes or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling result. The majority of ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for each system of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, around 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the type of heat.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
