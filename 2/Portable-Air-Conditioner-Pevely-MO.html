Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
