<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leaks, just including refrigerant is not a service.

<p>Since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for performance. Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly uncomplicated procedure. Installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite pricey if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
