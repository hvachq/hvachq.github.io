<h3>HVAC Repair Warnings You Should Never Ignore Durand MI</h3>
<p>Most people understand that outdoor air pollution can affect their health, however indoor air contamination can likewise have significant, damaging impact. EPA research studies of human exposure to air pollutants show that indoor levels of toxins might be 2 to 5 times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- higher than outdoor levels.

Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
