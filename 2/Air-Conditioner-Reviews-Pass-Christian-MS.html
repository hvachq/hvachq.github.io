<p>Sun Ray Solar water heater need reasonably little attention. However, similar to any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is essential to keep the system functioning efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system resemble those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank must be checked for leakages, the system ought to be flushed occasionally to remove tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in difficult water locations). The systems should be inspected at least two times annually for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be washed occasionally to eliminate dust gathered in order to improve collector efficiency.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Ensure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
