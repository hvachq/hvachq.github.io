Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is sincere, trustworthy, and affordable on cost. It's hard to find an honest AC person and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
