Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
