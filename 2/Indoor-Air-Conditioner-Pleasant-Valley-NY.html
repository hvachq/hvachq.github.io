<p>The first a/c and fridges utilized toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

Extra weatherization procedures must not be carried out until these problems have been fixed.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
