<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, as opposed to industrial or outside settings. In tasks where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It may likewise include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to specific areas.<p>

Here's why buying the best size a/c matters: if you buy an HVAC system that's too big, you'll wind up squandering money and energy.
