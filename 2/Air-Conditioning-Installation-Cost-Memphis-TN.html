<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
