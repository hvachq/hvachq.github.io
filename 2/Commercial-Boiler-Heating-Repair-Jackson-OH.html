<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same. Once the circuitry is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly cure and solidify-- normally two to 4 weeks.
