<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most economical. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
