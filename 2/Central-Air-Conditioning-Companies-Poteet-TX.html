<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

At lower levels of exposure, CO triggers mild results that are typically mistaken for the influenza. These signs consist of headaches, lightheadedness, tiredness, disorientation and queasiness. The results of CO direct exposure can differ significantly from person to individual depending upon age, total health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
