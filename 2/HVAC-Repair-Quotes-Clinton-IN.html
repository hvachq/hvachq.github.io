<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
