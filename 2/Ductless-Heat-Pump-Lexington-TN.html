<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most effective heating sources in regards to ecological costs. Because the energy used to heat your home is extracted straight from the ground, it protects the environment from hazardous digging, fracking, or contaminants.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
