Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
