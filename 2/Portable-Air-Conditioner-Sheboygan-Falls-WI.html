Once the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively solidify and treat-- usually two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
