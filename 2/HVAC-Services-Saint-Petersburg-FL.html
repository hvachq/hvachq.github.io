<h3>Discontinue Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water at Saint Petersburg FL</h3>
<p>Sean was very handy. He is a really enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
