<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We selected getting something more costly than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our greatest utility costs. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
