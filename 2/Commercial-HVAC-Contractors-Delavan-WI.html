<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Just like many house improvement projects, the cost of a full central heating unit can differ widely based on the size of the house. The majority of heaters will last in between 15 and 20 years.

Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A small home, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too quickly and shut down for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
