<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was extremely comprehensive and on-time in explaining what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn provided great customer service at the end of the visit by describing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance jobs we might wish to have done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques used by some in the market.<p>
<p>Volatile natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from processes or items; for the a lot of part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

Sources of VOC contamination from outside might include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water usage.<p>

They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for seven years, even though it was 6 months prior to the existing one ended. She didn't need a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
