<p>There are lots of sources of indoor air contamination in any home.

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to ten years old, it could suck up to two times the electrical power that even a low-end new one would use. That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment set up just a couple of years earlier.<p>
