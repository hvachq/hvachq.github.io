<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
