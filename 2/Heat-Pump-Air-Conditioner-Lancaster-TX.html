<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and place of contaminant exposure. An example of time control is setting up flooring waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This permits items to off-gas over the weekend while most of the personnel are at house over the weekend. Location control involves moving the toxin source away from occupants or perhaps moving prone occupants.<p>
<p>Our indoor air quality experts can convert your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To decrease contaminants, we suggest installing innovative air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are created to remove the tiniest particles from the air. The OxyQuantum UV sterilization systems likewise help control bacteria and organic smells. Many store-bought filters can not get rid of these tiniest of allergens and don't get rid of gases and germs.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a regular oil change in your car. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. Throughout high use months, examine the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
