Cool operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its appearances in the beginning. However then realized Air conditioners are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>There's a big distinction between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common kind of house heating-- convection.

Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the floors, walls and ceilings heated up. In turn, the things in the room, like furniture and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>
