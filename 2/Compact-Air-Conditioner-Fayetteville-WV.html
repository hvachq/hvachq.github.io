<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller home, which will affect installation costs. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other elements that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioning system and fridges employed flammable or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to deadly accidents when they leaked.

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
