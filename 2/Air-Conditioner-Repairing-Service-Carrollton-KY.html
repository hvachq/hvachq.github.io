<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
