<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC system. The best feature of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the problem and repaired extremely rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>The primary factor homeowners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the amount of services provided. The cost might not be worthwhile if the system is brand-new and still under a producer's warranty. Any major repairs need to be covered under the manufacturer's service warranty. However, some producers need routine maintenance as a regard to the warranty.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to offer enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A typical component essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
