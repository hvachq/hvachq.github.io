<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
<p>It is particularly important to take as many of these steps as possible while you are involved in short-term activities that can produce high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint removing, heating with kerosene heating units, cooking, or participating in maintenance and hobby activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding.
