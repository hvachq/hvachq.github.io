<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more difficulties, since a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
