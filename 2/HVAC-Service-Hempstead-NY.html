On those days when you simply can't seem to heat up and find you need to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your house and leave your sinuses pulsating. In-floor heating systems are not prone to this problem because they heat surfaces and not the air itself. Additionally, since they do not trust fans, ducts, returns and registers to distribute hot air, in-floor heater can lower the quantity of dust and seasonal irritants in your house.<p>
