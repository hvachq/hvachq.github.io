<p>Another alternative to oil furnaces are gas heating systems While oil is generally used in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have a choice in between the two types. Gas furnaces cost about the very same, approximately $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real advantage of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, instead of the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough job that the employees sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps guys working. When a sales guy concerns your home he is there to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and should not "need" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I provide you the choices for your requirements and you choose if you need it.<p>
