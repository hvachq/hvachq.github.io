<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Sunnyside WA 98944</h3>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
