<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in every month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use car debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
