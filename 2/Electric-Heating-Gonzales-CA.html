<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money can be found in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
