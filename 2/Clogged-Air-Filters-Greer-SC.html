<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very valuable in collecting information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to temporarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and provided clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
