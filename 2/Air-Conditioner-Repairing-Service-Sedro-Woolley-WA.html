<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and place of pollutant exposure. An example of time control is arranging floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This permits items to off-gas over the weekend while most of the staff are at home over the weekend. Location control involves moving the contaminant source far from occupants or perhaps relocating prone residents.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it could grovel two times the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to supply a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than devices set up just a couple of years back.<p>

In truth, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates homeowners could make their unit in between 5 and 15 percent more effective simply through regular filter replacements!
