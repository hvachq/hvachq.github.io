<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the visit. They suggested changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the see or the new part. I was really pleased they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>
