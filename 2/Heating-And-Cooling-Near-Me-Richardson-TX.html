<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature of the floor. All electrical wiring for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is dry and unblocked.<p>
<p>The majority of well and city water does not normally include lead. Water normally gets lead inside the house from family pipes that is made with lead materials. The only method to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it checked. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to discover how to get the water tested. Send for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to learn more about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.<p>
<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the very same. When the wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately treat and harden-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
