<h3>Ductless AC System in Apollo Beach FL 33572</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
