<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing product to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>Occupational direct exposure limits use dose-response data which show the health impacts of repeated exposure to one particular chemical.

<p>The most hazardous asbestos fibers are too small to be visible. After they are breathed in, they can remain and build up in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be fatal). Signs of these diseases do not show up until several years after exposure began. The majority of people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some industrialized disease from exposure to clothing and equipment brought house from task sites.<p>
