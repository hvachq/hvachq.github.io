The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power must not go beyond the capability of the outdoor unit.

<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones.

The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each space. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
