<p>A packaged unit, typically installed on the roofing system, is most typically used on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems include not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system separately, given that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are typically only offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best alternative for homeowners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
