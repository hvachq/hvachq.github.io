<p>The predominant health impact associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
