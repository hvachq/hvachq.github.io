<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, much of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>A SEER score stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at differing temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the very same duration. Essentially, SEER offers more information based upon how the EER performs in different temperatures. The greater the system's SEER ranking, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>

What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
