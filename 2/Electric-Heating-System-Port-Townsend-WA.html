Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
