Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
