<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate great however Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns.

Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
