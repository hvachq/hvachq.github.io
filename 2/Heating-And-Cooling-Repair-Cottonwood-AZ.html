<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
