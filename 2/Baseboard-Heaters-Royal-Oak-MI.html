<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day ac system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system boost. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
