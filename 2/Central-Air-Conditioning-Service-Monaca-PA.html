<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built.

Radon gas goes into homes through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floorings, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. Exposure to radon ends up being a concern when radon becomes trapped in concentrations and buildings build up indoors.<p>
