(If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor.
