<p>If the AC does not shut off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place over time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.
