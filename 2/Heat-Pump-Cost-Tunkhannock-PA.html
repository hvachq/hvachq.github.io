All the wet hot air that passes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the area that is being cooled. You'll have a water leakage if your HVAC system is not draining appropriately. A restriction in your drainage pipelines triggers a water leakage. There are various places a blockage can happen. Among the main areas where blockages begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
