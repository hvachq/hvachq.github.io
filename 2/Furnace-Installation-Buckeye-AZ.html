The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit resemble those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank should be checked for leakages, the system must be flushed occasionally to remove tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in difficult water areas).

In turn, the things in the space, like furnishings and people, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
