<h3>Factors to Consider When Looking for a Good AC Repair Company in Apollo PA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
