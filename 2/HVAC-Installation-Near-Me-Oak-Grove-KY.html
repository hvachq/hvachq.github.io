<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory guarantees remain in place. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is often difficult to measure, as one reaction mentioned the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't simply break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the result of repetitive use of an element that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early degeneration, causing fractures and holes. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the part.  a very useful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>
