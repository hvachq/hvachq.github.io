<h3>Commercial Air Conditioner in Torrington CT 06790</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
