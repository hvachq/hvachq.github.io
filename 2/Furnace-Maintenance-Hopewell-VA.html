<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their total power must not exceed the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect much better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, considering that the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor system.
