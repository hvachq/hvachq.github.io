<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your financial investment by just using the services of a certified contractor or a certified representative from a service or merchant to do the installation. If you select to try to do it yourself, or employ a non-licensed individual to do the work, in the majority of, if not all cases, you will void the guarantee for the air conditioning system. A voided service warranty will not do you any great should the system stop working or breakdown. Do it right from the outset and employ a licensed person with the experience to install the system.<p>
