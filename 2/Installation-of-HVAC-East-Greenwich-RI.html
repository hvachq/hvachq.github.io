A/c help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in incredibly humid environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is oversized, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c will need more energy to cool your house. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level.

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins and that unexpected shot of coolness when it turns off.<p>
