<h3>A Look At Ductwork At Charlestown RI Commercial Buildings</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We decided on getting something more pricey than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
