<h3>Hints to Help You Hire West Union OH Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>The icing issue ends up being a lot more serious with lower outside temperatures, so heat pumps are typically installed in tandem with a more traditional type of heating, such as an electrical heater, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized rather of the heatpump throughout harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
