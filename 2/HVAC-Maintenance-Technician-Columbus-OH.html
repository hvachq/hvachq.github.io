<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures sometimes utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to supply thermal convenience indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors develops the need for mindful attention to humidity levels inside.

<p>Because they eliminate wetness from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a normally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To handle condensate problems, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, below.<p>
