<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can pay for, a lot of Seattleites need to discover methods to combat the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in big box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring display screens.
