<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most affordable. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
