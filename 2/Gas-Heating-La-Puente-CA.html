<h3>AC Repair Contractor in La Puente CA 91744</h3>
<p>I have been using them for years for my businesses, my own houses and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He assisted me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is sincere, reliable, and reasonable on cost. It's tough to find an honest AC man and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Though it may be difficult to believe, the air inside your house can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are well-known for lowering the air quality in your home, however there are lots of other toxins that can not just dirty up the air, however cause other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and structure products add to poor air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (volatile natural substances) from paint and even from some kinds of carpets and upholstery products can trigger problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from procedures or products; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>For instance, Carrier has introduced its Unfavorable Air Maker for medical facilities that it states cleans up contaminated air and prevents it from infecting different sections of a healthcare facility. Senseware, an intelligent building startup understood for air quality monitoring, released a solution package in collaboration with other vendors to help clients securely reopen their businesses. Molekule, a residential air cleanser start-up, introduced a new product, now for healthcare use, and received a FDA 510( k) Class II Medical Gadget Clearance.<p>
