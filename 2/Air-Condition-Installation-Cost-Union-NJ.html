For instance, a heat exchanger might fail too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early wear and tear, leading to holes and fractures. , if that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the component.. a really advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
