This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
