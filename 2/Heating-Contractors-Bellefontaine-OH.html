But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel expenses all of a sudden appear greater than normal, it is probably time to consider a new system.

<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as just radiant systems.

When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
