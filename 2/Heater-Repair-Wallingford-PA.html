All wiring for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is dry and unobstructed.<p>
<p>Before you head out and purchase an a/c unit, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be setting up the a/c unit?
