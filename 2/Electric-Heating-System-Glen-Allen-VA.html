<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was required and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater because the technicians thought they just didn't seem right and they could not leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
