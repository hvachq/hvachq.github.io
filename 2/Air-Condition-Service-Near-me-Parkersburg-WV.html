<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really helpful in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to temporarily deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and offered clear interaction about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
