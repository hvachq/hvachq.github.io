<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
