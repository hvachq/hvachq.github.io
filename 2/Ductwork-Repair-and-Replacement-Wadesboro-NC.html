<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Do not put the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it because it tires warm air out the top. Any air flow restriction will lower the system's efficiency. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
