He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service several years back and understand the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.

<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for homeowners to consider. Many times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system separately, given that the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are normally only available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best choice for property owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
