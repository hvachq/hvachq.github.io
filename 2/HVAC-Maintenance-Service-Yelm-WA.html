<h3>How to Keep Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in Yelm WA</h3>
<p>The types of heating ventilation and a/c (HVAC) systems are as various as the various houses they serve (single household homes, duplexes, mobile homes, homes, high-rise condos, row housing, etc.). No matter what the type of house HVAC system, adequate air circulation (ventilation), correct filtering, and humidity control all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will make sure that it is operating safely and not adding to or causing an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
