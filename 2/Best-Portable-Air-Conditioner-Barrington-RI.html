<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer. Connection concerns along the line that supplies power to your furnace can compromise the efficiency of the unit. Loose, defective or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and disrupt service. Part of keeping your furnace includes checking the suggested connections as well as temperature and pressure gauges. Take time to examine these parts for dust and damage, making certain that they are tight and safe.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
