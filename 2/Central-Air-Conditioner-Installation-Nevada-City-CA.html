<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
