<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer.

<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am really amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years earlier and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roofing, is most typically used on commercial buildings, however it is likewise a choice for homeowners to think about. Many times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system individually, since the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are normally only offered for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best choice for house owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
