<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>
