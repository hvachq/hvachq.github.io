I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only factor he could not set up the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it very rapidly.

Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
