<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, a lot of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was kind of strange being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The product was exceptionally lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we resolved problems. I would advise this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
