<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity specialist at a big merchant who asked not to be called due to the fact that he did not have consent to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a group that regularly monitors energy consumption and temperatures in stores to minimize expenses (particularly at night) and to alert shop supervisors if temperatures in the shops fluctuate beyond an appropriate range that might avoid consumers from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building and construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures via natural and mechanical ventilation.

A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly positioned or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which may get in neighboring ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outdoor water fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
