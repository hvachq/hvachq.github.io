<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and really clear about his evaluation, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
