<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
