<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>

Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, try to find signs of issues with the ventilation in your house.
