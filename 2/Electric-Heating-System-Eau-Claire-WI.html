<p>This is especially notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. As soon as the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly harden and treat-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
