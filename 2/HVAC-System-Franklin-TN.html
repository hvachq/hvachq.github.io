<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
