If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut down completely.<p>

<p>Heat pumps are a dream come true for folks in Seattle. Cooling is something that the majority of Seattleites will only utilize sparingly, but due to the fact that heat pumps can offer both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the very best of both worlds! Not just are heat pumps practical, they are very energy efficient, too. If a heat pump remains in your future, the very best time to set up a/c in your home might extremely well be when your heater breaks down.<p>
<p>Generally the most efficient way to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient technique to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this section.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to supply sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A common aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
