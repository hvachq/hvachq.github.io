<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based only on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few reasonable ones received. Others were almost twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex effectively encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install team was considerate of my home and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post install inspection results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 system it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
