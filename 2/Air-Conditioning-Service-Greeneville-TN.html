<p>Routine maintenance keeps a furnace working efficiently, according to HVAC experts like Dave Mejean of B&W Plumbing & Heating in Indianapolis.

<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up routinely, they can become obstructed with particles that can restrict airflow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's performance.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

Many pieces of a furnace or a/c don't simply break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of repeated use of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing premature deterioration, leading to cracks and holes. , if that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the element.. an extremely useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
