Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
