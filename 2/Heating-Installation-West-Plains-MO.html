<p>These men have been excellent. At a realtor, I often require contractors to offer me an opinion for what work on a house may cost. Just recently I needed to call on these people twice. They came out rapidly and offered me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my client most likely would not wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Stability isn't simply their name, it's a company design they take seriously. You men are formally on speed dial. Talk with you quickly.<p>
