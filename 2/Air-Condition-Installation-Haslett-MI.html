<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Haslett MI</h3>
<p>Another technique to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming indoors. The majority of house heating and cooling systems, including required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors eliminate pollutants straight from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odor-free gas that hinders the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can trigger unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can trigger a variety of symptoms from headaches, d izziness, weakness, disorientation, confusion, and nausea, to fatigue in healthy people and episodes of increased chest discomfort in people with chronic cardiovascular disease. The signs of carbon monoxide poisoning are often confused with the influenza or food poisoning. Fetuses, babies, senior individuals, and individuals with anemia or with a history of heart or breathing illness can be specifically sensitive to carbon monoxide direct exposures.<p>
