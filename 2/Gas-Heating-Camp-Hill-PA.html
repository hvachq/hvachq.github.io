The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage effectiveness rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (revealed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the manufacturer's directions.<p>

<p>To help healthcare facilities dealing with patients with the unique coronavirus (COVID-19), Carrier released the OptiClean portable unfavorable air device, which eliminates and cleans up air possibly infected by the infection. The device cleans up infected air and prevents it from infecting various areas of a hospital; potential future uses with professional installation include houses, businesses, and helped living facilities.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off contaminants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in adequate outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
