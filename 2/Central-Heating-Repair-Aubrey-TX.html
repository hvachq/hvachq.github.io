<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
