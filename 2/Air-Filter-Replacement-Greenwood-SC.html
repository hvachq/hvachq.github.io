<h3>Furnace Installation Near me in Greenwood SC 29646</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
