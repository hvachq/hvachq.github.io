<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. In some cases it's not a significant issue, and your system may merely require some maintenance work. It is surprising how many people practice preventive maintenance on our cars and trucks, for example, but do not do the very same thing for the system that keeps us warm in the winter.

Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of if it ends up being damp.<p>
