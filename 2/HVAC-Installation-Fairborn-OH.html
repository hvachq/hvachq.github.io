<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a regular oil modification in your vehicle. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear.

Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters at least regular monthly.<p>

<p>A/c can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
