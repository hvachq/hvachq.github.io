<p>An undersize unit will not have the ability to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run since it has to run longer than a properly sized system. Since it just takes more electrical power to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The result is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
