<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the go to. They recommended changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was very happy they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>
<p>The fuel lines that supply gas to your furnace should also be inspected routinely. Dripping gas and fuel can be a fire threat. Disconnected fuel lines can compromise the efficiency of the HVAC system also. Soot can collect in burners and split heat exchanger s can have an influence on the system's performance as well.

<p>These men have been excellent. At a realtor, I sometimes require contractors to give me an opinion for what deal with a home might cost. Recently I needed to contact these men two times. They came out quickly and offered me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer most likely would not want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Integrity isn't simply their name, it's a service design they take seriously. You guys are officially on speed dial. Talk to you quickly.<p>
<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. When the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately treat and harden-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
