<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your home won't heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>These concepts-- and willingness to suffer through the heat-- might already be changing.

<p>In an area where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great main heater. You'll want to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperatures reach freezing.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to appropriately service and the system has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
