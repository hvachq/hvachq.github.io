<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. Connection issues along the line that provides power to your furnace can jeopardize the efficiency of the unit. Loose, missing or malfunctioning wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and disrupt service.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
