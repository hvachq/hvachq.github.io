<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and area of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is arranging floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday. This enables items to off-gas over the weekend while most of the staff are at house over the weekend. Location control includes moving the toxin source far from residents or perhaps relocating susceptible residents.<p>
<p>Benzene is a recognized human carcinogen. The primary indoor sources of this chemical are ecological tobacco smoke, saved fuels and paint products, and automobile emissions in attached garages. Actions that will lower benzene exposure include eliminating cigarette smoking within the home, providing for maximum ventilation throughout painting, and discarding paint products and unique fuels that will not be used instantly.<p>
<p>If your air conditioning unit is old, consider purchasing an energy-efficient model. Look for the ENERGY STAR Â® and EnergyGuide labels - qualified central systems are about 15% more effective than basic models. New residential central air conditioning conditioner requirements entered into effect on January 1, 2015; see the efficiency standards for central air conditioning conditioners for information, and consider acquiring a system with a higher SEER than the minimum for greater cost savings.<p>

<p>At present, EPA does not suggest utilizing air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay items. The effectiveness of these devices is uncertain because they only partly get rid of the radon decay products and do not reduce the quantity of radon entering the house. EPA plans to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or could become, a dependable methods of reducing the health risk from radon. EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers further info on air-cleaning gadgets to minimize indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Frequently, indoor air quality problems in large commercial structures can not be effectively determined or remedied without a detailed structure investigation. These examinations may start with written surveys and telephone consultations in which structure detectives evaluate the history of occupant symptoms and building operation procedures. In some cases, these queries may rapidly uncover the problem and on-site sees are unneeded.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge toxins.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
