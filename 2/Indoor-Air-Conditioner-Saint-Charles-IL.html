<p>If your ac system is more than eight years old, repair is probably not worth the expenditure, unless it's a simple issue like debris obstructing the condenser unit or a worn fan belt.

This decreases the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to offer heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the ac system into a heatpump While room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is typically more expensive than central air.<p>
