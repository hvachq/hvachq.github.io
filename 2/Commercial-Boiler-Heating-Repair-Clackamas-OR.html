<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by individuals and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
