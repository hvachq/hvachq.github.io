<p>Right now, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold might be living in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current study by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground. However much of the things people do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne impurities in their homes and aggravate asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
