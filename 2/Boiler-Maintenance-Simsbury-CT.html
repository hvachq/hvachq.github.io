<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
