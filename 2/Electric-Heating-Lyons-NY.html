<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c boost. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
