(If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
