All the wet hot air that travels through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then gotten rid of from the area that is being cooled. You'll have a water leakage if your HVAC system is not draining properly. A restriction in your drainage pipes triggers a water leak. There are several places a clog can take place. One of the main locations where blockages start to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
