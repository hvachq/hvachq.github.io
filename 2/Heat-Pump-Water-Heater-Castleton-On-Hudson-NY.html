<p>Heaters are like vehicles. As they age, you can replace one part only need another part changed or repaired next year.

<p>When our furnace was dying, we called 2 local companies for quotes. While both were useful and handy, Ballard Gas offered us a better deal, for exceptional service. Rather than an easy sales task, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating system and situated ways we could have more even heat. He consisted of these small however significant adjustments in his bid.

Air-side economizers likewise use outside air to condition areas, however do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outside air when proper.<p>
