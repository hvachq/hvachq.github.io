<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
