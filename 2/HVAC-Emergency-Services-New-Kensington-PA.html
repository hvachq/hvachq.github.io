<h3>How To Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in New Kensington PA</h3>
<p>A split air conditioning system may cost near to that of a conventional HVAC system however has actually proven to be an alternative cost effective option to houses that do not have ductwork. Used in addition to other kinds of heating or cooling, such as portable or window ac system, space heaters, or oil heaters, it can enhance the comfort of your home while keeping your month-to-month energy bill affordable.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
