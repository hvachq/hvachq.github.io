Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the unit sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
