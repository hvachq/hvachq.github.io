Among the main locations where clogs begin to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>There are numerous variables that add to indoor air contamination. Such aspects include using chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furnishings; carbon monoxide gas produced by cigarette smoke and outside traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls contained in electrical transformers; radiation from building insulation; ozone from photo copiers; and solvents used in cleaners, glues, photo copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
