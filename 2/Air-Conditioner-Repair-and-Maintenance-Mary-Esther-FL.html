Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>The Way to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Mary Esther FL</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
