<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating devices can last for years.

<h3>Gas Furnace Repair in West Jordan Utah</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>
