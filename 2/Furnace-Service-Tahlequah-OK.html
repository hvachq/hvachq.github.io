<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
