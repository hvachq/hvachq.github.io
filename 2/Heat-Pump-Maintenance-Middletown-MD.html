<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
