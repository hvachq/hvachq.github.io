Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
