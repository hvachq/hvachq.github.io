<h3>The Way to Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Ardmore OK</h3>
<p>Everyone deal with a variety of risks to our health as we set about our everyday lives. Driving in cars and trucks, flying in airplanes, taking part in leisure activities, and being exposed to environmental pollutants all posture varying degrees of risk. Some risks are simply inescapable. Some we pick to accept because to do otherwise would limit our ability to lead our lives the way we want. And some are dangers we might decide to prevent if we had the opportunity to make informed options. Indoor air pollution is one risk that you can do something about.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
