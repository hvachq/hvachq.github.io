<p>Filters can get dirty easily, particularly if you reside in a place that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, particles, germs, and clean the air. They're responsible for maintaining the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and replaced frequently, your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you anticipate it to.

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
