These companies may also need recommendations on which ENERGY STAR devices is the best suited for the size of a newly developed house.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more difficult to manage than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
