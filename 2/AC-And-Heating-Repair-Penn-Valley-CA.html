<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes.
