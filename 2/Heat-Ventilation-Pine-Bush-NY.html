<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or so.

<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Problems in Pine Bush NY</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating unit. We selected getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our greatest utility expenses. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things initially. Ensure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
