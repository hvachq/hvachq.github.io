<h3>AC Duct Replacement in Bowling Green KY 42101</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>

This is no longer the realm of the lone hacker however rather worldwide, the mob and they are far better financed and staffed than any of us could ever be.<p>
<p>If your single phase a/c isn't old enough to justify replacement, think about a whole home dehumidifier.
