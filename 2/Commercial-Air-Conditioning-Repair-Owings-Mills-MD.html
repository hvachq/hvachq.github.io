<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, but to have two significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>In a location where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heating unit.

<p>Fights the hot days: Though most temperatures in Seattle are acceptably average, you can expect a minimum of thirty days throughout which temperatures will reach above 80 degrees.
