Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
