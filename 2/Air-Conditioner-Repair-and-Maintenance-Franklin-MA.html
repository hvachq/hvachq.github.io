<h3>Heating Contractors in Franklin MA 02038</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
