<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day.

He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair price.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, go to Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
