<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ may discover moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical material gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
