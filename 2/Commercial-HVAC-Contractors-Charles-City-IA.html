<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Radiant heating provides a number of unique advantages over forced air heating systems. For instance, radiant heat systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems. They do not need to worry about duct leakages, which are responsible for output losses of as much as 30% in other heater types.
