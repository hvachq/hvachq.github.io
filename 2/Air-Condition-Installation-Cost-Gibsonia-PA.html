<p>After residing in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the a/c. I went ahead and bought this Carrier and I should say it gets the job done rather well. It takes very little time to warm up or cool down your home which is one of the things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had previously. The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was required and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater since the professionals thought they simply didn't seem ideal and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
