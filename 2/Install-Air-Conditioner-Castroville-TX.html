Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
