Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is dry and unobstructed.<p>
