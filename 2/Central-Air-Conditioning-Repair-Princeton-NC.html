<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit toxins.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
