<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your air conditioner is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Merely including refrigerant is not a solution if it leaks. An experienced technician ought to fix any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the appropriate amount of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the performance and efficiency of your a/c unit is greatest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the manufacturer's spec, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can likewise be damaging to the environment.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up routinely, they can become obstructed with debris that can limit air flow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's performance.

By comparison, checking and changing a furnace filter can generally be done in simply a couple of minutes, typically without any tools needed. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
