<h3>Is Your Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Mentone CA?</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
