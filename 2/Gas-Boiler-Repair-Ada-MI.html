A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
