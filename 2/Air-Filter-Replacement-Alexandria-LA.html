PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have two different units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them.

PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioner into a heatpump While room air conditioning supplies maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is normally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
