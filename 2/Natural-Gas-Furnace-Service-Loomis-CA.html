<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of various heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
