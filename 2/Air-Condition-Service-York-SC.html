This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to routinely clean the condenser coil.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them till they have actually been effectively dried.
