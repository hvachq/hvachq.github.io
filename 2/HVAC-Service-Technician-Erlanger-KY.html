<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have actually been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. If products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
