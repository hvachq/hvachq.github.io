<p>Indoor contaminants. These consist of chemicals utilized in the building and construction or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these appliances (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops must be used with fans that send out exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating appliances need to be sealed and power-vented systems installed to get rid of products of incomplete combustion.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which might go into nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
