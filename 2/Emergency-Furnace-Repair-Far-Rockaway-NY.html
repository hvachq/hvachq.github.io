Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>There are lots of actions a homeowner can require to choose products that will avoid indoor air issues from happening - a number of them are mentioned here.

We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's product and services was remarkable. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to perform the necessary electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>
