<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>
