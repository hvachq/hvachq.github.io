<p>Before setting up any new heating or cooling system in a house, it is essential to re examine and minimize the energy load of the house. A more energy efficient home will not just reduce the cost of a new system and utility expenses, but it will considerably enhance the convenience of your home. Before we design and set up any systems, we set up a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend improvements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Fundamental enhancements generally include adding insulation and air sealing procedures.
