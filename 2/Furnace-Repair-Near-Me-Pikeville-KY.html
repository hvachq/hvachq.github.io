<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor at Pikeville KY</h3>
<p>After living in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the air conditioning. I went ahead and bought this Provider and I must state it gets the job done quite well. It takes really little time to warm up or cool down the house which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had previously. The system hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
