Ventilation removes undesirable smells and extreme moisture, introduces outside air, keeps interior building air flowing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Lots of elements affect IAQ. These aspects include bad ventilation (absence of outdoors air), problems managing temperature, high or low humidity, current improvement, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air entering into the structure.
