<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it might flatter twice the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's because it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to offer a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than devices set up simply a few years back.<p>
