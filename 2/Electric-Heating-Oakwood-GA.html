<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Oakwood Georgia</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

Utilizing central vacuum systems that are vented to the outdoors or vacuums with high performance filters might likewise be of help.<p>
