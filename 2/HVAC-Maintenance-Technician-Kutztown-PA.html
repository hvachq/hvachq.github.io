<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. When the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately treat and solidify-- normally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
