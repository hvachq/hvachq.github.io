<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices normally lasts years, given that it is protected inside. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical standards eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely.
