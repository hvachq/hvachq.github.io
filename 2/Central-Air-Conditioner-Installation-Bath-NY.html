<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year.
