He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service many years ago and know the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
