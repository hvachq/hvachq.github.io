<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
