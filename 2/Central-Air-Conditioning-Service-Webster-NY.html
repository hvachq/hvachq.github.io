<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>A great location to start is to compare your oil or gas furnace age to the national average. The typical life expectancy of heaters in houses today is between 16 and twenty years.

Most people choose to change their furnace as a planned home improvement instead of a panic replacement when your furnace is faltering or has currently common life expectancy of a warm air furnace will vary based on its operating environment, that's why it's important to have the system serviced regularly by a certified technician. They will be able to effectively examine the condition of the furnace and make any recommendations.<p>
