The size of geothermal heatpump and the size of ground loop required depends on the heating & cooling requirements for your house and is vital iin ensuring the effectiveness and performance of the system. Capacity for geothermal systems is determined in tons. Typically, a 3-ton setup should be enough for the average house, but home size, heating and cooling requirements, local geology and soil, and land accessibility are all factors which will affect the proper size for your specific house.
