In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor impurities.

Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are very low, keeping track of information might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
