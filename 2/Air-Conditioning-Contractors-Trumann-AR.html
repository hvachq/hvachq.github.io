Nevertheless, choose your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners.

There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
