When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Pipe Creek TX</h3>
<p>Many people do not understand how humidity is eliminated from your Houston Midtown Tx home. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier. All the moist hot air that goes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the area that is being cooled. If your HVAC unit is not draining pipes effectively, you'll have a water leak. A limitation in your drainage pipelines causes a water leak. There are various locations an obstruction can happen. One of the main areas where clogs begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
