<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
