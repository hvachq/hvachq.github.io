<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Bedford Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>Trace was the service technician that looked after my semi yearly maintenance today. Trace was on time, courteous, and appreciated my house by constantly using boot coverings when entering my home. He showed the points of examination and also recommended I have a UV light set up due to a little buildup of mold accumulating in the air handler, which he completely examined and cleaned up the outside compressor coils as well as ensured the moisture discharge tube was clear by using a cleaning liquid and a shop vacuum. He also eliminated the leaves that collected inside the interior of the compressor system and suggested a service to avoid it from continuing, which will do.I received an in-depth e-mail report of the assessment detailing all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is an asset to Waychoff's and I extremely suggest him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
