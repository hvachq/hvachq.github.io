<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you ought to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
