<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that might impact the health of individuals who live in the home. Contaminants could come from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, backyard trash burning, or radon entering your home from the ground listed below. An air pollutant might likewise come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care products. Infections and bacteria, pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Air toxins can vary from pollutants generated from the outdoors by your family pets to dangerous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air contaminant resulting from natural gas that gets away into your home without being burnt. Older homes might include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In kitchens and bathrooms, mold and mildew can become a problem where moisture levels are typically higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
