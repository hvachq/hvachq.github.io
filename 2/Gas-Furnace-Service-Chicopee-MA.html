<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Chicopee MA</h3>
<p>Many people are aware that outside air contamination can affect their health, but indoor air contamination can also have considerable, harmful effect. EPA research studies of human direct exposure to air pollutants show that indoor levels of contaminants may be 2 to five times-- and sometimes more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board consistently rank indoor air contamination amongst the leading 5 environmental health threats to the general public.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not provide them.  Secondly like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found someone to correctly service and the unit has actually been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
