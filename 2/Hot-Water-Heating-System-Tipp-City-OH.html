<h3>HVAC Installation in Tipp City Ohio</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine.
