Many common structure materials used before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Generally, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the building products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation. Removal of asbestos-containing products is not always optimum because the fibers can be spread out into the air throughout the elimination process. A management program for intact asbestos-containing products is typically advised instead.<p>
