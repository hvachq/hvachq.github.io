We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating unit. We picked getting something more expensive than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy expenditures.
