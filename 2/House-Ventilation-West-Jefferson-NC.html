<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at varying temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the same period. Generally, SEER supplies more data based on how the EER performs in various temps. The higher the unit's SEER rating, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>

<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Needs in West Jefferson NC</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the mathematics lately, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years.

I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
