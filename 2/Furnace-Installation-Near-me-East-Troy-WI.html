<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide should be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the huge photo" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be established to provide threshold signals. If, for example, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you might set up your monitoring equipment to notify you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the appropriate action to fix the situation immediately.<p>
