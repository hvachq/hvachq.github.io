<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature deterioration, leading to holes and cracks. If that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.  an extremely advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
