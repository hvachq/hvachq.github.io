<p>The function of a lot of structure ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for occupant comfort while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing security at reasonable energy costs. Load determining is referred to as the Handbook J calculation and should be carried out by the HVAC contractor before providing an installation or system cost for cooling. If your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you require based upon experience or on square video footage alone, relocate to another contractor. Similar to determining the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, figuring out the proper size of system for your house likewise depends on the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs between $300 to $500 typically.
