<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Needs in Franklin KY</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
