<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
