<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The goal is to offer adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
