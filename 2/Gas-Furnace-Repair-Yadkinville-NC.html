<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
