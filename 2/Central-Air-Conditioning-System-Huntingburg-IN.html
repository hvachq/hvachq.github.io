Oftentimes, our understanding of the contaminants and their health impacts is too minimal to figure out the levels at which the listed effects might occur.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge pollutants.)
