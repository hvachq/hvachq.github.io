<p>All heating unit have some level of air purification. From one of the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some fundamental maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping airborne contaminants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping reduce the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have been revealed to trigger the health effects discussed. However, it is not always real that the effects noted take place at the pollutant concentration levels generally discovered in the house. Oftentimes, our understanding of the contaminants and their health impacts is too minimal to figure out the levels at which the listed effects might occur.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge pollutants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
