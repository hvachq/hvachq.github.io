<h3>Air Conditioner Repair in Placentia CA 92870</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
