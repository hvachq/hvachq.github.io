<p>A geothermal heater is more reliable than alternatives, and is not affected by any external aspects, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar power.

Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the sun nor the wind, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot.

<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Virginia Beach VA?</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions require.

Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
