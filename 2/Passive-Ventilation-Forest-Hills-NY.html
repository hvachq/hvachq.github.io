Nevertheless, many of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
