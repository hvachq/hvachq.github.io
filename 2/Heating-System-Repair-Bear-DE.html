<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't emit heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must suffice until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence residents. Unlike other kinds of air conditioning unit, evaporative coolers depend on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the within a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be enabled to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to maintain and comprehend.<p>
