<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that might affect the health of people who reside in the home. Pollutants could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon entering the house from the ground below. An air contaminant might likewise come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unstable organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or individual care items. Bacteria and infections, family pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also may contribute to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly might become blocked, decreasing air flow volume, circulation, and quality. They likewise might become places for bacteria and molds to be and grow dispersed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also must be properly maintained to avoid germs and mold contamination.<p>
