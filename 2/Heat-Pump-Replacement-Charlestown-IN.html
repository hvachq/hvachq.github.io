<h3>AC Compressor in Charlestown IN 47111</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
