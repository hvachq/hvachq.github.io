<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>To begin, it's an excellent idea to think about energy performance. By choosing a central AC unit that has as high of an effectiveness rating as possible, you can reduce your carbon footprint and conserve money in the long run. Performance rankings must be labeled with all units. While effective units may cost more, choosing an Energy Star-rated appliance is an excellent method to delight in extra peace of mind.<p>
<p>Almost half of Americans use air fresheners at least when a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that often, our nationally representative survey discovered. Roughly 40 percent seldom or never clean their humidifier or cooking area variety hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have never ever cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can aggravate indoor air quality.<p>
