<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
