<p>Geothermal heatpump cost is much more than other heat pump types when setting up the whole system. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.

Setting up a new geothermal heatpump to deal with an existing ground loop is far less expensive.<p>
<p>Before setting up any new heating or cooling system in a house, it is needed to re evaluate and reduce the energy load of the home. A more energy efficient home will not just decrease the cost of a new system and energy bills, but it will significantly improve the comfort of your house. Before we style and install any systems, we schedule a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will advise improvements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Standard improvements generally include adding insulation and air sealing procedures. Energy Environmental Corporation deals with and can advise several qualified home Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact United States for references.<p>
