<h3>Effective Methods for Furnace Cleaning in Hopewell Junction NY</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of replacing or exchanging air in any area to provide high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, co2, and other gases. Ventilation removes unpleasant smells and excessive moisture, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior structure air circulating, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
