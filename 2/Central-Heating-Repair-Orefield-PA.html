<p>My oldest son always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
