<h3>Heat Pump Repair in Hanson Massachusetts</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have two major components fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as vital as a routine oil change in your car. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. Energy Star suggests changing your filter when every 3 months. During high usage months, check the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
