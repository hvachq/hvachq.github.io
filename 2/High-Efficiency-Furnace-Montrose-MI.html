<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
