<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price excellent however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
