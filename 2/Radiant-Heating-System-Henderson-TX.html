<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
