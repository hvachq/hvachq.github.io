<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leakages, merely adding refrigerant is not a solution.

If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably straightforward procedure. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather costly if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
