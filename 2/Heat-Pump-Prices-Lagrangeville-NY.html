<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of.
