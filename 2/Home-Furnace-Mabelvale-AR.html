<p>While pollutants frequently found in indoor air are responsible for many harmful impacts, there is considerable unpredictability about what concentrations or durations of exposure are needed to produce specific illness. People also respond very differently to direct exposure to indoor air toxins. Further research is required to better comprehend which health effects happen after exposure to the typical pollutant concentrations found in homes and which happen from the greater concentrations that happen for brief periods of time.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, often referred to as central air" or split-system air conditioning", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floorings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
