They're priced fairly, have managed the one repair I needed well, and are expert and constantly on-time. Have been through a couple of companies over the years and Wachoff's is absolutely the best I have actually had the opportunity to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been fantastic.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in effectiveness advantage since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Since they do not require any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Because a system is set up in each space or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
