Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
