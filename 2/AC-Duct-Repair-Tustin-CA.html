The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>At present, EPA does not suggest using air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay products. The efficiency of these gadgets is uncertain due to the fact that they just partly eliminate the radon decay items and do not reduce the quantity of radon getting in the home. EPA plans to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or might end up being, a trustworthy means of lowering the health danger from radon. EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides more details on air-cleaning gadgets to decrease indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, because it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
