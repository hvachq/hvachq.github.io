<p>As a knowledgeable HVAC expert, we advise you have your systems examined and routine maintenance performed twice each year, when in the Spring (before cooling season) and as soon as in the Fall (before heating season). It goes without saying the security and comfort of your household or workplace personnel are essential factors. Keeping what is most likely the most expensive and crucial system in your house (cooling and heating) properly preserved will help keep your biggest financial investment of your life in excellent shape.<p>

The OxyQuantum UV sanitation systems likewise help control germs and natural odors. A lot of store-bought filters can not remove these smallest of allergens and do not eliminate bacteria and gases.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works however the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
