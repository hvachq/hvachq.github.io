<p>A health questionnaire should be established and dispersed to all worried workers. Such a tool should recognize the number of people affected; specify ages and task descriptions of involved workers; figure out where they are located within the workplace; suggest when the signs occur (time of day, day of week, and time of year); supply a list of particular health signs or diseases; determine all machines operated in the work environment; suggest the type of outdoors air pollution; and recognize possible sources of task tension.<p>
<p>The contaminants noted in this guide have actually been shown to cause the health impacts mentioned. However, it is not necessarily true that the effects noted take place at the pollutant concentration levels normally discovered in the home.

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling residents. Unlike other types of a/c unit, evaporative coolers depend on the outside air to be funnelled through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the inside of a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be permitted to push the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to keep and understand.<p>
