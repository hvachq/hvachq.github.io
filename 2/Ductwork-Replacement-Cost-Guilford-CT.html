<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you should check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
