<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my companies, my own houses and my property customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me problem shoot the problem. He is honest, dependable, and sensible on price. It's hard to discover an honest AC person and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>If you are considering setting up a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your home, intend on investing numerous thousand dollars for the complete system.

<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more difficult to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity ought to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
