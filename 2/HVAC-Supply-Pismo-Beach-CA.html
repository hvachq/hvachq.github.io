<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Immediate impacts may show up after a single exposure or repeated exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate impacts are treatable and generally short-term. Sometimes the treatment is merely getting rid of the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Symptoms of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise show up not long after exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Lots of individuals are ending up being more conscious and concerned about their health and the impact of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt including allergens and contaminants can cover the cooling ductwork with time. Occasionally it needs to be removed to boost and revitalize the quality of indoor air and enhance the cooling. Beacon Plumbing, Seattle, WA cleans up the duct physically by getting rid of the debris from the air filter.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two should not be puzzled.

The 2 operations utilize different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to achieve its objectives.<p>
