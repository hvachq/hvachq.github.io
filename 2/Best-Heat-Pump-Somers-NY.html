<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year.

Hope this helps.<p>
