<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Many common building materials used prior to 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Generally, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the building materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Removal of asbestos-containing materials is not always optimum since the fibers can be spread out into the air during the elimination procedure. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing materials is frequently recommended instead.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
