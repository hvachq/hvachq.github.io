<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go someplace. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting for mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a effective and straightforward technique to decrease ambient air contamination and potential health threats, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off pollutants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house residents. Unlike other kinds of air conditioners, evaporative coolers count on the outside air to be directed through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the inside of a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air must be enabled to press the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to comprehend and maintain.<p>
