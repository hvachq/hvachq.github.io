If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off totally.<p>

<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely practical in collecting details on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to momentarily manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
