<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<h3>The Way to Pick An HVAC Company at Bergenfield NJ</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the mathematics recently, but I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and want to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a tube twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
