<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide need to be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for calculations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
