<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
