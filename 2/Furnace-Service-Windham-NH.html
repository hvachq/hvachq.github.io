<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater. We chose getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
