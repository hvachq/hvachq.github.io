<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00.

<p>My oldest child constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, flooring, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to 2 days might end up being a source for mold development and need to be discarded. Often there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can thrive in hidden or rarely accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding.

Completely tidy the area utilizing recognized health department recommendations.<p>
