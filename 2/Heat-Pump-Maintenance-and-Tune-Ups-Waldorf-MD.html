<p>We contacted Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the hottest days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out very same day to evaluate circumstance & decided to choose them for the work.

<p>My eldest child always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often referred to as central air" or split-system a/c", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the walls, floorings, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioner to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
