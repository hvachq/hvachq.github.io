<p>The pollutants noted in this guide have been revealed to trigger the health impacts mentioned. Nevertheless, it is not always true that the effects kept in mind happen at the pollutant concentration levels usually discovered in the house. In most cases, our understanding of the toxins and their health impacts is too limited to determine the levels at which the listed results could happen.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release contaminants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Moist and humid conditions reproduce mold and mildew that can set off respiratory issues like allergic reactions and asthma. Depending upon your area, the hot summertime can bring about specifically damp conditions.

There are a variety of humidifier options that will help preserve constant humidity levels and develop comfortable living conditions in your house.<p>
