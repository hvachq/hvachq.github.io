<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make certain all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>

<p>When business is less hectic, it can be the perfect time to brainstorm innovative techniques for promoting your HVAC company also. For instance, you may try taking part in home and garden shows, exhibition or other sort of occasion marketing. Or perhaps you'll present a contest, a free gift or a special financing plan to boost equipment sales. If the experiments settle, you can formalize them as part of the marketing method you outline in next year's company strategy.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that just a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, however a house owner does not have the skills or tools required to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and appropriate airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the essential devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still required to have an expert technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
