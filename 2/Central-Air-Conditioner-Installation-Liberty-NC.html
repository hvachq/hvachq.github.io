<p>I normally don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
<p>We look at clues prior to we provide recommendations to change instead of repair a heater. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are higher every year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be squandering cash by not changing the older unit.<p>

<p>The steadiness of the industry's development does not necessarily equate to the experience of operating an HVAC company.
