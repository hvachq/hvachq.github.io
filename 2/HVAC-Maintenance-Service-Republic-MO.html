<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run due to the fact that it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
