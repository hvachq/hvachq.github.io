A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your car's cooling system.

<p>The predominant health result connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
