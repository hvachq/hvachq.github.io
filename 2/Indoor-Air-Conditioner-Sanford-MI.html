<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Have to Know Before Buying in Sanford MI</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is a really pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it really quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
