<p>One of the disadvantages of central heating is that it's potentially costly to install, particularly in an older house. Depending on the type of unit installed, it can be noisy and trigger problems if you're highly allergic to dust. In addition, specific fuels and equipment may require unique permits, and there is minimal versatility in the event of altered heating requirements. During use, there is a dead time while heat is being transferred from the heating system to the home.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
