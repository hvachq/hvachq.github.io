Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
