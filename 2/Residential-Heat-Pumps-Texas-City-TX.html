There are numerous methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, weakening paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled, Airborne lead enters the body. Before it was understood how hazardous lead might be, it was used in paint, gas, water pipes, and numerous other items.<p>

It might be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
