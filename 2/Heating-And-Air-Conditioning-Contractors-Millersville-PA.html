<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with regular preventive maintenance, however, there will constantly be the odd problem that occasionally comes up. When you do discover your furnace behaving oddly, it is really essential that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible. The faster you react to problems with your furnace, the much easier they are to fix. Waiting to require repairs will just make the issue even worse, and frequently more pricey.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners are more effective than room air conditioning unit. In addition, they run out the way, quiet, and practical to operate.

<h3>The Way to Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Millersville PA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating unit. We chose getting something more expensive than a standard water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
