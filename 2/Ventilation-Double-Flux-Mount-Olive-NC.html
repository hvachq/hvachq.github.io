Instead of a simple sales task, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heater and located methods we might have more even heat. He included these substantial but small changes in his bid.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use car debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
