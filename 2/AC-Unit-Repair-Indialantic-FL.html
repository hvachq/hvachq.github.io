<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>

<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. Due to the fact that approximately 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless unit has an integrated efficiency benefit. Because they don't need any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Due to the fact that a system is set up in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
