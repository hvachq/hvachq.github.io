Lots of typical structure materials used prior to 1975 include asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products.

<p>Specific immediate impacts resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is typically difficult to identify if the signs are an outcome of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is very important to take notice of the time and place the symptoms occur. If the signs fade or disappear when an individual is far from the house and return when the person returns, an effort should be made to determine indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some results might be intensified by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the cooling, humidity, or heating conditions common in the home.<p>
<p>Air flow patterns in structure are figured out by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural results.

Even if the opening is small, air will move until the inside pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
