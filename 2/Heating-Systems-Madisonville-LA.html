<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from products or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a brand-new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
