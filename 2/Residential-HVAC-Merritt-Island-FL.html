<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

They weren't cheap however a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was really happy they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will absolutely be utilizing them once again.<p>
