<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types.

Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
