<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical product over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
