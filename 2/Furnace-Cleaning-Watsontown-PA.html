<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical product gradually. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
