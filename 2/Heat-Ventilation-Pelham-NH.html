<p>In 2011, NASA watched for an air conditioning system to set up in their lunar electric rover. They chose they needed professional help and spoke with various suppliers.

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
