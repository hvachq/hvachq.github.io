<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heating unit, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>
