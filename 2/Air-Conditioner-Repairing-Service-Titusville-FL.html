<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release contaminants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
