<p>The function of many building ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for occupant comfort while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and developing safety at sensible energy expenses. Load computing is described as the Manual J computation and must be carried out by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or system cost for air conditioning. If your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square footage alone, transfer to another contractor. Similar to measuring the size of a system required based on BTUs, identifying the proper size of unit for your house also depends upon the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>

By 2016, a Wall Street Journal article anticipated that green housing will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole real estate market.<p>
