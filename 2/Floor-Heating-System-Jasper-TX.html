<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately positioned or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which might enter close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
