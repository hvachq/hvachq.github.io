<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Alpine CA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit.

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Make certain all the signs up in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
