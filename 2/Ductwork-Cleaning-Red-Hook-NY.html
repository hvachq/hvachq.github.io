<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner at Red Hook NY</h3>
<p>The remainder of the HVAC system likewise needs to be in top condition for the air conditioning system to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which live inside the home. If the private parts are in appropriate order, the technician can examine the ductwork for signs of holes, spaces or extreme dirt. Sealing leakages in ductwork can enhance HVAC efficiency by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler home in the hot summer.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
