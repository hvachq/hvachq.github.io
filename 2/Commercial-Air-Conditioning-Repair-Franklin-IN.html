<p>Check these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
