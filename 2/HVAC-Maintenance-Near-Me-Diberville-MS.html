The most efficient fans are resilient and quiet. Use fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors.

A great rule of thumb is to run a bathroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
