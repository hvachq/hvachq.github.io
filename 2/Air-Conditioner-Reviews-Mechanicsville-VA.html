<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do decline them until they have been effectively dried. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
