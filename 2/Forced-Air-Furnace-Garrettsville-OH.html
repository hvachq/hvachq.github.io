<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit require fairly little attention. However, just like any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is vital to keep the system operating smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system resemble those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank must be looked for leakages, the system should be flushed occasionally to eliminate tank and gathered impurities (scaling in tough water locations).

The collector's glass can be washed occasionally to get rid of dust collected in order to improve collector efficiency.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
