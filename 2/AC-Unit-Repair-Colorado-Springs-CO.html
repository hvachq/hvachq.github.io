<p>Immediate discounts on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are available to equipment installers, used at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Excellent Client Service! Climate Pro is reputable and genuinely cared about us and our scenario. We got home one evening to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came by that same night. Although he didn't have actually the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could try to find and buy it the next early morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely grateful to have a heated home once again. What's most amazing was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover somebody to help us right prior to a vacation, however Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily suggest this company to my good friends.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
