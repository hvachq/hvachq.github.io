The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
