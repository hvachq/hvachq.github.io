What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
