<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your home. Heatpump operate on electricity and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>A specialized a/c unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard ac system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the same air course. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, since all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is really heated up, just as by an electric heating system that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
