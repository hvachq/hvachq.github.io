If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
