<p>My oldest son always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I recognized that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think about anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The sound level is low and itâ $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems.
