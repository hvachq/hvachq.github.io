<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really helpful in collecting info on the phone and offering clear directions about how to temporarily manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and provided clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
