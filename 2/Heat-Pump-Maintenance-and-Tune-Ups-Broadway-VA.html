<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Problems in Broadway VA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Clogged rain gutters can result in water seeping into your house, leading to mold development, according to the EPA.
