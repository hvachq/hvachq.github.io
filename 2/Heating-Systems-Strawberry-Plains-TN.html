This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

By comparison, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can usually be performed in just a couple of minutes, often without any tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
