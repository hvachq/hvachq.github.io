Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut off totally.<p>

<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the objective of owning an organisation was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the exact same in all other areas.<p>
