<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
