<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the visit. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost however a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was really pleased they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>
