<p>, if the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't provide agreements.. The so called reliable companies swindle more individuals than the fly by night outfits. I understand because I tried to work for them. Due to the fact that 90% of them are scoundrels, I quit. They walk in with or without an agreement and start offering you things you do not need. They lie. How do I know. I now work as a consultant to confirm the so called treatments and issues. 9 out of 10, I examine are totally incorrect.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
