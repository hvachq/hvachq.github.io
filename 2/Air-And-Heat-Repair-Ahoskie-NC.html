<p>If you remain in the very first few years of company, you may choose to keep your product and services line simple for now. But if you are an established company in the process of revising your cooling and heating company strategy, think about whether you are all set to add some complementary sales or services, such as pipes, insulation, duct sealing, indoor air quality evaluation or system performance reviews.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Whether your a/c has stopped blowing cool air or it makes strange sounds, call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric for an expert assessment.
