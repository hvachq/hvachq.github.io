<p>Your ventilation, air, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the prospective to negatively affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, germs, and extremely little particles of dust.

Insulation might be a more effective service to your cooling issues than changing your equipment.<p>
