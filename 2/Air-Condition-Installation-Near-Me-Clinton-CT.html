<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>PE firms tend to run with the objective of selling or spinning off a firm at some time. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a large business in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, previously this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for three years prior to that.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in adequate outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
