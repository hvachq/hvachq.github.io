<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
