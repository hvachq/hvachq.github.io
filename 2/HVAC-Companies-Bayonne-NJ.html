<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating units are still widely utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners are more effective than space ac system. In addition, they are out of the way, quiet, and practical to run.
