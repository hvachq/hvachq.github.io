If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the proper temperature. Heating systems that kick on frequently may be due to an unclean filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
