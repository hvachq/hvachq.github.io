The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>There are numerous variables that add to indoor air pollution. Such aspects consist of the use of chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furnishings; carbon monoxide released by cigarette smoke and outdoors traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls included in electrical transformers; radiation from developing insulation; ozone from photo copiers; and solvents utilized in cleaners, glues, photo copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
