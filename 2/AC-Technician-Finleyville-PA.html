This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
