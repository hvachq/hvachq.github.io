I have 2 heaters - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators. This normally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window. Radiant heat supplies warmth from the floor up throughout the room without any cold spots or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
