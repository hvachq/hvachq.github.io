<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
