<p>, if the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not provide agreements.. The so called trustworthy companies swindle more individuals than the fly by night attire. Due to the fact that I attempted to work for them, I understand. I give up due to the fact that 90% of them are scoundrels.

I now work as an expert to verify the so called problems and treatments. 9 out of 10, I examine are entirely wrong.<p>

<h3>Electric Heating in Lancaster OH 43130</h3>
<p>We needed 2 visits - Jake came out initially and was really experienced and pleasant and courteous. Grant came out a couple days later and was good and also well-informed to talk with. They both did an excellent job. Sabre's office staff is extremely useful, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and supplying the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are also well priced for their services. Certainly recommend.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were great! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested. They satisfied my requirements totally by offering an expert quote with choices, without pushing additional products. The team appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also quickly followed up with the required examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
