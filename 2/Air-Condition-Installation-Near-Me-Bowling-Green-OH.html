Furnaces that kick on regularly might be because of a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>

<p>I am very impressed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years ago and understand the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
