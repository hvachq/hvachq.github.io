<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
