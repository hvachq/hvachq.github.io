In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " number one environmental threat to the health of kids in the United States." There are numerous ways in which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was known how damaging lead could be, it was used in paint, fuel, water pipes, and numerous other items.<p>

An air pollutant might also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, unpredictable organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or personal care items. Infections and germs, pet dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
