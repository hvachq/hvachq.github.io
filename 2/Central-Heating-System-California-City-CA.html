Sources of formaldehyde in the home include building products, smoking cigarettes, household products, and using unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating systems.

Loosen the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Photo 6).<p>
