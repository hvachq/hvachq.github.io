<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
