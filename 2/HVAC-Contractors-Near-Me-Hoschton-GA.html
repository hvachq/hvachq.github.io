<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, check out Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
