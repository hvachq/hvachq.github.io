<h3>Get Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Towanda PA</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>

<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, because it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical standards remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
