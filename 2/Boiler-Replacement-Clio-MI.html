<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold.

The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
