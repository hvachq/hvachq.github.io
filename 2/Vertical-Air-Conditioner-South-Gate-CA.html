<p>Poor indoor air quality is usually caused by the lack of sufficient ventilation, which results in a buildup of contaminants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health determined inadequate ventilation as the primary problem in more than half the office indoor air examinations it has performed. Examinations performed in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually found the very same to be true. These examinations exposed that appropriate ventilation is essential in preserving great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
