<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, providing warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
