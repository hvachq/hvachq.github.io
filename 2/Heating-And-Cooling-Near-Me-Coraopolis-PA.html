The firm began in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for years, until the required for high-efficiency systems forced Goettl to end production.

<p>The very first air conditioners and refrigerators utilized combustible or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could lead to deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
