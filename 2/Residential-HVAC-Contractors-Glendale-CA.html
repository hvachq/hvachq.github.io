<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

<p>A specialized a/c unit that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioning system because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the exact same air path. A basic a/c unit transfers heat energy out of the space due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat is eliminated. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is actually heated, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
