<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by improving air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
