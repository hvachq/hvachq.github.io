<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is a really enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns other than the blower motor.
