And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, location 2 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>The lifespan of a central air conditioning unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's a/c unit are more energy effective than designs made 5 years earlier, so it makes financial sense to change or upgrade your system if it's five years old or older.
