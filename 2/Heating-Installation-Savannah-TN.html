<p>Generally the most efficient way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions.

<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roofing system, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, however it is also a choice for property owners to consider. Often times, these units contain not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system independently, considering that the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are normally only offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best option for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
