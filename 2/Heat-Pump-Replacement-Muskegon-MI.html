<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or laboratory environments, rather than outdoor or commercial settings.

<h3>Heating Strategies For Gas Home Furnaces in Muskegon MI</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even little window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater because the specialists thought they simply didn't appear best and they could not leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
