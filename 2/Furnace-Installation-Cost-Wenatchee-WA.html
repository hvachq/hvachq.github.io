<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
