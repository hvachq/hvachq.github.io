At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than necessary.<p>

Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system.
