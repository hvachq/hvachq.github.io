Some impacts may be worsened by an inadequate supply of outdoor air coming indoors or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions common inside your home.<p>
<p>Space air conditioners feature a thermostat sensing unit, situated behind the control board, which measures the temperature of air entering into the evaporative coil.

<p>Chemical pollutants: Unstable organic substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are various, varied, and common. They include both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds. Chemical pollutants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from items utilized in the building (e.g., office devices; furniture, wall and flooring coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer products) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>This is especially notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater.
