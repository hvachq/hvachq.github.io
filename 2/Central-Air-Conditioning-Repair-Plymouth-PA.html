<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>The fuel lines that provide gas to your furnace need to also be examined routinely. Dripping gas and fuel can be a fire hazard. Disconnected fuel lines can compromise the efficiency of the HVAC system too. Soot can accumulate in burners and cracked heat exchanger s can have an influence on the system's efficiency as well.

<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items consist of vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. These products present a risk just when they are managed in a way that creates dust containing asbestos fibers which can be breathed in.
