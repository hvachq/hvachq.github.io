<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a company was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't completion goal.
