<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
