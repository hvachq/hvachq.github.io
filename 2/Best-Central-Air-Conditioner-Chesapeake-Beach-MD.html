<p>Fantastic Product! Shipment was sort of unusual being that package was opened and products might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was very lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we solved problems. I would recommend this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the very first time.

<h3>Central Heating Installation Agency in Chesapeake Beach MD</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in vehicles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by lots of individuals.<p>
