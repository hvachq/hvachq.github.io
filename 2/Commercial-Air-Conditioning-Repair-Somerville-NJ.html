<h3>Furnace Service in Somerville NJ 08876</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest won't come on. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that protect your a/c system from flooding. One of the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great chance; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency security switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on unusual events.<p>
