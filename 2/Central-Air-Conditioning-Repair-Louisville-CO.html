<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC system is wintry. Also, if the a/c unit smells bad, there could be bacteria accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil absorbs the heat far from your house.

<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely pleased that somebody as skilled as Adam was able to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c unit before you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to check AC units even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
