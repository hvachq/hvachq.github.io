<p>There are many actions a property owner can take to select products that will prevent indoor air problems from happening - a couple of them are mentioned here. First, utilize exterior-grade pushed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an option, think about using solid wood products. Secondly, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make sure that an effective wetness barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. If it ends up being damp, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of.<p>
