<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the exact same.

Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately cure and solidify-- normally two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
