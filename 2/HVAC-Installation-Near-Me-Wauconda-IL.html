<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a reference in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
