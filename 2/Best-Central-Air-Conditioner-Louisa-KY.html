A more energy effective home will not just minimize the cost of a new system and utility bills, however it will greatly enhance the convenience of your house. Before we design and install any systems, we schedule a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will advise improvements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Standard improvements normally include adding insulation and air sealing steps. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can suggest several certified home Energy Star auditors and installation experts. Please Contact United States for references.<p>
