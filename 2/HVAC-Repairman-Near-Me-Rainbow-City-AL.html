<p>This in flooring heating system consists of one thin constant cable heating aspect woven into a mat that you install under the tile.

<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place over time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
