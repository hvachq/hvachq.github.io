<p>Open windows or utilize exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common method of decreasing direct exposure to indoor air contaminants, also will decrease however not remove direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke. Because cigarette smoking produces such big quantities of contaminants, mechanical or natural ventilation strategies do not remove them from the air in your home as quickly as they build up. In addition, the big increases in ventilation it requires to significantly minimize direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses considerably. Consequently, the most effective way to reduce direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the home is to remove smoking there.<p>

<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that wetness has to go someplace. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting for mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a reliable and simple approach to minimize ambient air contamination and prospective health risks, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
