<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, but numerous utilize the general rule that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a much better option. If the current system has not sustained other significant repairs, is in otherwise exceptional condition, and concerns that led to the breakdown can be identified and remedied, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense too.<p>
<p>The early couple of years of your company are an exciting time, and it's appealing to let pure enthusiasm direct your path forward. However if you want your new HVAC organisation to have staying power, you must step back and dedicate the essential time to developing a company strategy. And keep in mind that an organisation plan for an HVAC company isn't implied to be a static document. It's a structure to revamp or guide the launch of your business that you can build upon and restructure as the business evolves.<p>
