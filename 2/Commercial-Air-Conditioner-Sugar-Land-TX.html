<p>When central air service stops working throughout a heat spell, you may have to wait days for an HVAC repair technician or an ac contractor to appear, and you'll probably pay a minimum of numerous hundred for the repair.

<p>Power resources: Confirm your access to electrical resources. Many older houses have restricted ability to add significant home appliances at the level of a central air conditioning conditioner.

<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
