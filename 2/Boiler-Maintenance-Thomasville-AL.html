<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>HVAC is a vital part of residential structures such as single family houses, apartment, hotels and senior living centers, medium to big industrial and office buildings such as medical facilities and high-rise buildings, cars such as cars, trains, aircrafts, ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are controlled with respect to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
