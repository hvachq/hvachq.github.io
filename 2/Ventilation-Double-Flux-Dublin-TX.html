Their techs are really educated and professional. Costs are sensible. Always on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff set up a brand-new air handler and condenser this week. Because the cost was certainly reasonable, I did not bother to get competitor's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff.<p>
<p>Space a/c feature a thermostat sensor, situated behind the control panel, which determines the temperature of air entering the evaporative coil. The air conditioner could cycle constantly or behave unpredictably if the sensing unit is knocked out of position.
