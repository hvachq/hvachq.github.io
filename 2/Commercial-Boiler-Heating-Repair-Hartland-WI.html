An option to packaged systems is using separate indoor and outside coils in split systems Split systems are preferred and widely used worldwide except in The United States and Canada. In North America, split systems are frequently seen in residential applications, however they are gaining popularity in small commercial buildings.

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
