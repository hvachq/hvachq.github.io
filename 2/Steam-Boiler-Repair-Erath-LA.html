<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season cooling.

Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage.
