<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
