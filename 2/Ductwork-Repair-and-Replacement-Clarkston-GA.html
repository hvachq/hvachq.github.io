<h3>The Advantages of Buying A New Furnace at Clarkston GA</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in automobiles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and used by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by numerous people.<p>
