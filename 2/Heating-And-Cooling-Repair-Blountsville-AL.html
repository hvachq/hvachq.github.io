<h3>Different types of HVAC Repairs in Blountsville AL</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will require to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, really filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
