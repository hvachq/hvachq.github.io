<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 should be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the huge image" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be established to offer threshold signals. If, for instance, the outdoors air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could set up your tracking equipment to inform you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached crucial point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the suitable action to solve the situation right away.<p>
<p>Occupants of homes with poor indoor air quality might complain of signs such as headache, eye inflammation, tiredness, dry throat, sinus dizziness, nausea, and blockage. Detecting ill building syndrome is difficult because lots of health problems can cause these symptoms. Extremely high levels of some impurities, such as carbon monoxide, can trigger more serious health problem, including death.<p>
