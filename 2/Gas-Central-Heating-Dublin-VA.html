In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system boost.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
