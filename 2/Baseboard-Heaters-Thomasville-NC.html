<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot next to the radiators. This generally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Convected heat supplies heat from the flooring up throughout the room with no cold spots or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
