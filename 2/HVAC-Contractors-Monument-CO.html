<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was sort of strange being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we dealt with issues. I would recommend this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
