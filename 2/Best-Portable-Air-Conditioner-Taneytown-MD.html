<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

<p>Equipment costs are driven by the kind of furnace at the heart of your home heater. Low-efficiency designs will cost less, but lead to greater energy expenses. High-efficiency designs cost more, but conserve more over the long run. Prices for gas furnaces range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models approximately $12,500 for high-efficiency models. Electric heating systems begin at $395 and vary up to $1,700 or more depending upon the brand and furnace size.<p>
