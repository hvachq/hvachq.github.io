<p>Examine these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2).

<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on.
