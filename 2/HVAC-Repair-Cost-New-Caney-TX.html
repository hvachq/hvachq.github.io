<p>Examine these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's good air flow at the signs up.

<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
