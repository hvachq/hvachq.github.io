<p>Co2 (CO2) is a relatively simple to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants released by people, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high inside may cause residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of co2 in most buildings.

Ventilation, a typical technique of decreasing direct exposure to indoor air pollutants, also will lower but not eliminate exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.

In addition, the large boosts in ventilation it requires to substantially minimize exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs considerably. Subsequently, the most efficient method to reduce exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to eliminate cigarette smoking there.<p>
