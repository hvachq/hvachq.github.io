People might complain of several of the following symptoms: dry or burning mucous membranes in the nose, eyes, and throat; sneezing; stuffy or runny nose; tiredness or sleepiness; headache; lightheadedness; queasiness; irritability and forgetfulness.

Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
