<p>Most Midtown Houston Tx clients don't understand why their HVAC system is not working when they position a 24 hr emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's more than likely your issue. If you found that your conditioning filter needs changing, then the next step is to thaw your a/c devices. The easiest method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
