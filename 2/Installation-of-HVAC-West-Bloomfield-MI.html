<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside unit as near the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
<h3>Air Condition Repairing in West Bloomfield Michigan</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and efficiently, but to have 2 significant components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
