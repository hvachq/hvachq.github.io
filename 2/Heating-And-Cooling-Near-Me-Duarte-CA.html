<p>In homes, the most considerable sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pushed wood products made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood items made for indoor usage consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard includes a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood product and is usually recognized as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood product.<p>

This could be through a public offering, a sale to a large service in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, previously this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for three years before that.<p>
