<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can manage, so many Seattleites need to discover ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in huge box shops like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are taken up as soon as they're stacked in flooring display screens.
