<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System because of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heating systems have multiple control panel. The largest, or just one in some heaters, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control board should be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t correctly diagnosed, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when installed. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine components. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, check out Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
