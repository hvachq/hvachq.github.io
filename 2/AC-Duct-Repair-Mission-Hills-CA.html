<p>A health questionnaire need to be developed and distributed to all worried employees. Such a tool ought to identify the variety of individuals impacted; define ages and job descriptions of involved employees; figure out where they are located within the workplace; indicate when the signs take place (time of day, day of week, and season); supply a list of particular health signs or health problems; identify all machines operated in the office; suggest the type of outdoors air pollution; and identify possible sources of job tension.<p>
<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
