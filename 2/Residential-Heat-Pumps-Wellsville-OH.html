<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my organisations, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the issue. He is honest, reputable, and reasonable on cost. It's hard to discover an honest AC guy and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
