<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor system as near the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
