<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
