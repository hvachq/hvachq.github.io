<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works but the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
