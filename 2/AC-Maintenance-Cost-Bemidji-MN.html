<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather.

The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>
