Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet.

But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>

Am thankful I got this though because it has actually restored my faith in great manufacturing. I havenâ $ t had a problem with this new Provider I got because I purchased it 7 months back.
