<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ might notice unpleasant or musty odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might choose to replace the outside compressor with a modern, high-efficiency unit. If you do so, seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor unit. Nevertheless, considering current modifications in refrigerants and a/c designs, it may be smarter to replace the entire system.<p>
