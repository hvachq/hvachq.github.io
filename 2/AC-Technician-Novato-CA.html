<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which might go into neighboring ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical facilities and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
