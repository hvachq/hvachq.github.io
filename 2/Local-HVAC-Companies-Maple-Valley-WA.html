These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects are generally short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is merely removing the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Right after direct exposure to some indoor air pollutants, signs of some diseases such as asthma may appear, be worsened or intensified.<p>

<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go someplace. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a effective and straightforward approach to lower ambient air pollution and prospective health risks, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your home might have bad indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, try to find indications of issues with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can show your home might not have sufficient ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls, foul-smelling or stuffy air, filthy central heating and air cooling devices, and areas where books, shoes, or other items end up being musty. To find odors in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether smells are obvious.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
