<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his inspection, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
