<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning system works but your home does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
