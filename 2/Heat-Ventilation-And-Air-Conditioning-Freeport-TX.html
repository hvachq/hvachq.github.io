<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
