<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
