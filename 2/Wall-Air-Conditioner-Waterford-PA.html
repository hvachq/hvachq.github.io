<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>
