<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that just a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, however a house owner doesn't have the skills or tools needed to inspect refrigerant levels.
