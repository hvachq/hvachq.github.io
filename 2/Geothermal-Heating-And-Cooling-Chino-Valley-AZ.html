<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ problem. Your employer needs to inspect measurements of air, humidity and temperature level flow. In addition, examination and testing of the ventilation, heating and air conditioning systems (to make sure it is working according to specifications for building usage and occupancy) need to be performed. A structure walk-through to check for odors and try to find water damage, leakages, dirt or pest droppings might be valuable. Leakages need to be removed.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) is a reasonably easy to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants produced by people, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high indoors may trigger occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels.

You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
