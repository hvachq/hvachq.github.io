<p>Find Out About PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage effectiveness rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure.
