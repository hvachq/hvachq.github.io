<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leakages, simply adding refrigerant is not an option. A qualified technician should repair any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the appropriate amount of refrigerant. Remember that the performance and efficiency of your ac system is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the producer's requirements, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be harmful to the environment.<p>
