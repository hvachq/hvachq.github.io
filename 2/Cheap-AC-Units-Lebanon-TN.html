Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be shut off completely.<p>

<p>Make certain there are no rugs, furnishings, or anything else limiting the flow of air. Not just will obstructed vents and registers impact your convenience, they can also result in duct leakages due to excessive air pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and signs up in unused rooms is NOT a good idea. You won't save any extra money and will wind up causing more problems for your heater.<p>
