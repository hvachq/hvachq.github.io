<p>How environment change impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants.

This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
