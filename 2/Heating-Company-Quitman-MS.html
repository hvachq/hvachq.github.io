After two years, things started to alter. There have actually been awkward sounds. I got it inspected and fixed. I am hoping that is the end of the concern.

But then realized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
