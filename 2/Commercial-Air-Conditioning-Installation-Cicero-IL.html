<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent.

The radiators may be mounted on walls or set up within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
