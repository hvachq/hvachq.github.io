<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
