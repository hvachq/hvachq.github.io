<p>Specialist heater setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC professionals suggest following this basic rule when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's finest to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than necessary.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is easy to install, particularly if you make it part of a build or remodelling project. For instance, Warmup's StickyMat solution can be installed as a DIY job as it is simple to lay down with the electric wire being all pre-spaced and easily connected to the mesh, ready to be presented in location.

<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
