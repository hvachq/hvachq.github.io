<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
