<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment).

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
