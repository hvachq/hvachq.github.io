<p>Before cooling or installing any brand-new heating system in a home, it is needed to re evaluate and reduce the energy load of the house. A more energy effective house will not just minimize the cost of a brand-new system and utility costs, but it will considerably improve the convenience of your home. Before we design and set up any systems, we schedule a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will advise enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these enhancements. Basic improvements typically include adding insulation and air sealing procedures. Energy Environmental Corporation deals with and can advise a number of competent home Energy Star auditors and installation experts. Please Contact United States for references.<p>

No extra charge.<p>
