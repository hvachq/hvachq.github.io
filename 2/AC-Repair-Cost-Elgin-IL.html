<p>We got in touch with Elite A/C on among the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to evaluate circumstance & chose to opt for them for the work. I enjoy to state that not just did we get the central air conditioning going but likewise changed the heating system which was old. Everybody we spoke to from beginning to end were really expert, considerate and the work was very effectively done. I would extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
