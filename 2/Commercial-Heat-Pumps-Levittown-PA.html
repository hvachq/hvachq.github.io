<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for several years. However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel bills unexpectedly appear higher than typical, it is most likely time to think about a new system. New heating devices is far more effective-- you'll see lower fuel expenses immediately, not to point out the money you'll save money on repair costs. If your heating unit is 25 years old or more, you can most likely anticipate to cut your fuel costs in half.<p>
<p>Truth: Federal and local rewards typically amount to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can often make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with conventional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, during brand-new construction (houses normally use in between one and 5 heaps). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. Nevertheless, new installation practices are decreasing expenses, to the point where the price is getting closer to conventional systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
