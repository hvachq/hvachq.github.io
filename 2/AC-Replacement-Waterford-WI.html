<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Waterford WI</h3>
<p>Sean was very practical. He is a really enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
