<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
