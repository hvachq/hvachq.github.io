<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more difficulties, because some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
