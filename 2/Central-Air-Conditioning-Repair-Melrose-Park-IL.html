<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern ac system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit boost. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
