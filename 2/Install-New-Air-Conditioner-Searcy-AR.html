<p>IAQ can be impacted by gases (including carbon monoxide, radon, unstable natural compounds ), particulates, microbial pollutants (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stress factor that can cause negative health conditions. Source control, filtration and using ventilation to dilute pollutants are the main methods for enhancing indoor air quality in the majority of structures. Residential units can even more enhance indoor air quality by routine cleaning of carpets and rug.<p>
<p>Airflow patterns in structure are figured out by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural results. Air pressure distinctions developed by these forces move air-borne contaminants from locations of higher pressure to locations of lower pressure through any offered opening in structure walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move up until the inside pressure is equal to the outside.<p>

Specialists suggest using filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller particles and typically are more appropriate for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
