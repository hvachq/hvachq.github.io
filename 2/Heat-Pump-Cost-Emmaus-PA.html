The essential portion of your cooling is the outside system. Without it, you have no cooling.

<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

Longtime Seattle house owners are finally giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not provide them..

Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to properly service and the system has actually been running issue free for the past 2+ years.
