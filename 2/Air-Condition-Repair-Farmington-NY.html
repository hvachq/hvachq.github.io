<p>Houses can have the exact same indoor air problems as single-family houses since many of the contamination sources, such as the interior building materials, home furnishings, and home products, are comparable.

<p>When the level of brand-new building and construction activity decreases, service technicians who specialize in brand-new installation work may experience durations of unemployment. Repair and maintenance work, however, usually stays reasonably stable. Business owners and property owners depend on their climate-control or refrigeration systems year round and must keep them in excellent working order, regardless of economic conditions.<p>

<p>A geothermal heater is more reliable than options, and is not affected by any external elements, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar energy. For example, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar energy depends on routine sunlight to work effectively. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the sun nor the wind, however rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a readily available and reliable  source of energy.<p>
