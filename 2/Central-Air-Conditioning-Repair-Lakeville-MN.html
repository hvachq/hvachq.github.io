Stale air might also be a problem when ventilation is not adequate to represent a boost in the number of employees in the area.<p>
<p>Some health impacts may appear shortly after a single direct exposure or duplicated direct exposures to a contaminant.

<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit".
