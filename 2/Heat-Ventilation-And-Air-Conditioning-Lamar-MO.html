<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a recommendation later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
