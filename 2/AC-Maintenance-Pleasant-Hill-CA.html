In-floor heating is not even tracked in the annual Cost vs. Value Report provided by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Improvement Publication. Possibly Realtors should think about too many variables to definitively mention what a radiant heating system might add to, or subtract from, any given asking rate. That stated, property buyers wanting to go green," who prioritize energy savings, or who definitely want an in-floor heater will be willing to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>
