<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area.

Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
