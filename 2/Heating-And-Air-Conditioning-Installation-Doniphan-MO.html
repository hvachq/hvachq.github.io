<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a referral later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4).

The female crimp adapters need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
