<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
