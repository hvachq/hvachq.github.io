<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
