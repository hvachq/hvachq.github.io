<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them up until they have been correctly dried. Try a various dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
