He clearly and completely described all issues and repairs in a way that made me positive in his ability to resolve my repair problems. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally get a required part that was not in stock, making sure repairs were made so that my better half and I would not need to withstand another night without heat, during one of the coldest winters in recent memory.

<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant devices producer's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in location. Furthermore, the concrete results of a PM is often difficult to quantify, as one response mentioned the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioner don't simply break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the result of recurring usage of a component that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering early deterioration, causing fractures and holes. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the element.  a really helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>
